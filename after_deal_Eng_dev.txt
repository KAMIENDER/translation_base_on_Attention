nor is it alarming .
the us economy grew rapidly for several years after wwii with a higher debt/gdp ratio , and today’s ratio is lower than in all other major industrial countries ( and roughly half that of greece , analogies to which are absurd and misleading ) .
during the last two years , washington has been obsessed with the need to cut the deficit and put the debt/gdp ratio on a “ sustainable ” path , even as global investors have flocked to us government debt , driving interest rates to historic lows .
the considerable progress that has been made on deficit reduction over the next ten years has been overlooked .
also overlooked have been the immediate challenges of low growth , weak investment , and high unemployment .
it is time to refocus .
the us needs a plan for faster growth , not more deficit reduction .
evsey domar , a legendary growth economist ( and one of my mit professors ) counseled that the problem of alleviating the debt burden is essentially a problem of achieving growth in national income .
we should heed his wisdom .
america’s new progressive era ?
new york – in 1981 , us president ronald reagan came to office famously declaring that ,  “ government is not the solution to our problem .
government is the problem . ”
thirty-two years and four presidents later , barack obama’s recent inaugural address , with its ringing endorsement of a larger role for government in addressing america’s – and the world’s – most urgent challenges , looks like it may bring down the curtain on that era .
reagan’s statement in 1981 was extraordinary .
it signaled that america’s new president was less interested in using government to solve society’s problems than he was in cutting taxes , mainly for the benefit of the wealthy .
more important , his presidency began a “ revolution ” from the political right – against the poor , the environment , and science and technology – that lasted for three decades , its tenets upheld , more or less , by all who followed him: george h . w . bush , bill clinton , george w . bush , and , in some respects , by obama in his first term .
the “ reagan revolution ” had four main components: tax cuts for the rich; spending cuts on education , infrastructure , energy , climate change , and job training; massive growth in the defense budget; and economic deregulation , including privatization of core government functions , like operating military bases and prisons .
billed as a “ free-market ” revolution , because it promised to reduce the role of government , in practice it was the beginning of an assault on the middle class and the poor by wealthy special interests .
these special interests included wall street , big oil , the big health insurers , and arms manufacturers .
they demanded tax cuts , and got them; they demanded a rollback of environmental protection , and got it; they demanded , and received , the right to attack unions; and they demanded lucrative government contracts , even for paramilitary operations , and got those , too .
for more than three decades , no one really challenged the consequences of turning political power over to the highest bidders .
in the meantime , america went from being a middle-class society to one increasingly divided between rich and poor .
ceos who were once paid around 30 times what their average workers earned now make around 230 times that amount .
once a world leader in the fight against environmental degradation , america was the last major economy to acknowledge the reality of climate change .
financial deregulation enriched wall street , but ended up creating a global economic crisis through fraud , excessive risk-taking , incompetence , and insider dealing .
maybe , just maybe , obama’s recent address marks not only the end of this destructive agenda , but also the start of a new era .
indeed , he devoted almost the entire speech to the positive role of government in providing education , fighting climate change , rebuilding infrastructure , taking care of the poor and disabled , and generally investing in the future .
it was the first inaugural address of its kind since reagan turned america away from government in 1981 .
if obama’s speech turns out to mark the start of a new era of progressive politics in america , it would fit a pattern explored by one of america’s great historians , arthur schlesinger , jr . , who documented roughly 30-year intervals between periods of what he called “ private interest ” and “ public purpose . ”
in the late 1800’s , america had its gilded age , with the creation of large new industries by the era’s “ robber barons ” accompanied by massive inequality and corruption .
the subsequent progressive era was followed by a temporary return to plutocracy in the 1920’s .
then came the great depression , franklin roosevelt’s new deal , and another 30 years of progressive politics , from the 1930’s to the 1960’s .
the 1970’s were a transition period to the age of reagan – 30 years of conservative politics led by powerful corporate interests .
it is certainly time for a rebirth of public purpose and government leadership in the us to fight climate change , help the poor , promote sustainable technologies , and modernize america’s infrastructure .
if america realizes these bold steps through purposeful public policies , as obama outlined , the innovative science , new technology , and powerful demonstration effects that result will benefit countries around the world .
it is certainly too early to declare a new progressive era in america .
vested interests remain powerful , certainly in congress – and even within the white house .
these wealthy groups and individuals gave billions of dollars to the candidates in the recent election campaign , and they expect their contributions to yield benefits .
moreover , 30 years of tax cutting has left the us government without the financial resources needed to carry out effective programs in key areas such as the transition to low-carbon energy .
still , obama has wisely thrown down the gauntlet , calling for a new era of government activism .
he is right to do so , because many of today’s crucial challenges – saving the planet from our own excesses; ensuring that technological advances benefit all members of society; and building the new infrastructure that we need nationally and globally for a sustainable future – demand collective solutions .
implementation of public policy is just as important to good governance as the vision that underlies it .
so the next task is to design wise , innovative , and cost-effective programs to address these challenges .
unfortunately , when it comes to bold and innovative programs to meet critical human needs , america is out of practice .
it is time to begin anew , and obama’s full-throated defense of a progressive vision points the us in the right direction .
america’s new trade hypocrisy
as the current “ development round ” of trade talks moves into its final stages , it is becoming increasingly clear that the goal of promoting development will not be served , and that the multilateral trade system will be undermined .
nowhere is this clearer than in a provision that is supposed to give the least developed countries almost duty-free access to developed countries’ markets .
a year ago , the leaders of the world’s richest countries committed themselves to alleviating the plight of the poorest .
at doha in november 2001 , they pledged to give something more valuable than money: the opportunity for poor countries to sell their goods and earn their way out of poverty .
with great fanfare , developed countries seemed for a while to be making good on their promise , as europe extended the “ everything but arms ” initiative ( eba ) , under which it was unilaterally to open its markets to the poorest countries of the world .
the opening was less than it seemed .
the devil is in the details , as many less developed countries discovered that eba’s complicated rules of origin , together with supply-side constraints , meant that there was little chance for poor countries to export their newly liberalized products .
but the coup de grace was delivered by the world’s richest country , the united states , which once again decided to demonstrate its hypocrisy .
the us ostensibly agreed to a 97% opening of its markets to the poorest countries .
the developing countries were disappointed with the results of europe’s eba initiative , and europe has responded by committing itself to dealing with at least part of the problem that arises from the rules of origin tests .
america’s intention was , to the contrary , to seem to be opening up its markets , while doing nothing of the sort , for it appears to allow the us to select a different 3% for each country .
the result is what is mockingly coming to be called the ebp initiative: developing countries will be allowed freely to export everything but what they produce .
they can export jet engines , supercomputers , airplanes , computer chips of all kinds—just not textiles , agricultural products , or processed foods , the goods they can and do produce .
consider bangladesh .
if we go by the most widely used six-digit tariff lines , bangladesh exported 409 tariff lines to the us in 2004 , from which it earned about $2 . 3 billion .
but its top 12 tariff lines – 3% of all tariff lines – accounted for 59 . 7% of the total value of its exports to the us .
this means that the us could erect barriers to almost three-fifths of bangladeshi exports .
for cambodia , the figure would be about 62% .
the situation is no better if the 3% rule applies to the tariff lines that the us imports from the rest of the world ( rather than to the lines individual poor countries export to the us ) , for then the us can exclude roughly 300 tariff lines from duty-free and quota-free treatment .
for bangladesh , this implies that 75% of the tariff lines , accounting for more than 90% of the value of its exports to the us , could be excluded from duty-free treatment .
exclusion from duty-free treatment could reach 100% for cambodia , which exported only 277 tariff lines to the us in 2004 .
the official argument for the 3% exclusion is that it affects “ sensitive products . ”
in other words , while the us lectures developing countries on the need to face the pain of rapid adjustment to liberalization , it refuses to do the same .
( indeed , it has already had more than 11 years to adjust to liberalization of textiles . )
but the real problem is far worse because the 3% exclusion raises the specter of an odious policy of divide and conquer , as developing countries are invited to vie with each other to make sure that america does not exclude
indeed , there may be a further hidden agenda behind the 97% proposal .
at the world trade organization’s meeting cancun in 2003 , the developing countries stood together and blocked efforts to forge a trade agreement that was almost as unfair as the previous uruguay round , under which the poorest countries actually became worse off .
it was imperative that such unity be destroyed .
america’s strategy of bilateral trade agreements was aimed at precisely that , but it enlisted only a few countries , representing a fraction of global trade .
the 97% formula holds open the possibility of extending that fragmentation
the us has already had some success in pitting the poor against each other .
preferential access for african countries , under the african growth and opportunity act ( agoa ) and more recent initiatives , seems to be largely a matter of trade diversion – taking trade from some poor countries and giving it to others .
for example , bangladesh’s share in us clothing markets declined from 4 . 6% in 2001 to 3 . 9% in 2004 .
during the same period , agoa countries’ market share in the us clothing sector increased from 1 . 6% to 2 . 6% , and it is likely to increase further when agoa countries start to take full advantage of duty-free access .
agoa had a sunset clause , but if the duty-free access becomes permanent for less developed countries in africa – as stipulated in hong kong – then poor countries in asia will continue to lose us market share .
the wto is supposed to prevent these trade-diversionary agreements , but so far no case has been successfully brought .
even if america succeeds in dividing the developing countries , however , it may inspire a degree of unity elsewhere .
both those committed to trade liberalization within a multilateral system and those committed to helping developing countries will look at america’s new strategy with abhorrence .
game changers for growth
berkeley – the recent g-20 meeting of finance ministers in saint petersburg confirmed that the debate between growth and austerity is over – at least for now .
with protracted recession in europe and slowdowns in emerging markets , concern about budget deficits has given way to apprehension about growth .
in july , the international monetary fund revised its global growth forecast downward for the second time this year .
both japan and the united states stand out as bright spots in the subdued global outlook , but for different reasons .
in japan , prime minister shinzo abe has unleashed a combination of aggressive monetary and fiscal expansion along with promised reforms of the labor market , corporate governance , regulation , and trade .
in response to rapid and bold stimulus measures , japan’s economy is expected to grow at a rate of around 3% this year – one of the highest rates among advanced economies – and the nikkei index rose 80% in the six-month period ending in may of this year .
now abe has signaled his intention to move forward with tough structural reforms .
if he delivers , his policies will be game changers for japan .
in the us , the story is one of continued recovery as the headwinds slowing growth dissipate .
state- and local-government budgets are improving , the housing market is strengthening , and households are deleveraging and repairing their balance sheets .
counterproductive and excessive fiscal austerity at the federal level has dampened growth this year , but the private sector has proved more resilient than expected .
under current law , fiscal contraction is slated to ease next year and monetary policy is likely to remain supportive , so most forecasters predict an acceleration of growth .
but growth prospects could be undermined by another bruising political battle over the federal budget , resulting in deep spending cuts .
the current republican rhetoric in the house of representatives portends additional fiscal austerity .
earlier this year , the congressional budget office warned that the potential us growth rate has declined as a result of years of subpar investment rates , the aging of the population , and smaller productivity gains .
every year of below-capacity growth means lower growth capacity in the future , owing to lost investment , erosion of worker skills and experience , and diminished risk-taking .
still , there are often-overlooked reasons for optimism about america’s future potential growth .
a recent mckinsey global institute study identifies five mutually reinforcing “ game changers ” that could have a significant effect on gdp growth , productivity , and employment in the us by 2020: shale energy , big-data analytics , exports in knowledge-intensive industries , infrastructure investment , and talent development .
two of these – shale energy and big-data analytics – build on ongoing technological breakthroughs in which the us has a strong lead and depend primarily on private-sector action , not macroeconomic or structural policies .
us production of shale gas and oil has been growing by more than 50% annually over the last five years .
as a result of increasing supplies , us natural-gas prices have declined by two-thirds since 2008 and are likely to remain significantly lower than prices in the rest of the world at least through 2020 .
this price advantage will enhance america’s competitiveness as a manufacturing location , particularly for energy-intensive activities .
the us has the largest recoverable shale-gas reserves and the second-largest recoverable shale-oil reserves in the world .
it also enjoys a technological lead in shale-energy technologies , and it already has a vast network of pipelines , refineries , and ports in the energy sector that can be repurposed for shale gas and oil ( though much more investment will be needed ) .
growth in shale energy will mean more investment , production , and jobs in the energy sector itself .
lower gas prices will boost manufacturing production , particularly in downstream industries like petrochemicals and primary metals that use natural gas as fuel and feedstock .
growth in energy and energy-intensive industries will fuel additional demand , output , and employment across a wide swath of supporting activities , including transportation , construction , and professional services .
overall , mckinsey estimates that growth in shale energy could add 2-4% to annual gdp and create up to 1 . 7 million jobs by 2020 .
but extracting shale energy involves environmental risks and uncertainties , among them groundwater contamination , higher methane emissions , and potential seismic effects .
and shale gas emits co2 when burned , even though it has half the carbon content of coal and has played a significant role in cutting us carbon emissions to mid-1990’s levels . &#160;
not surprisingly , the president of the natural resources defense council , an admired environmental group , recently remarked that “ fracking is about the most complicated thing i have encountered . ”
more research on the environmental risks and benefits of shale energy , and the development of new standards and regulations to control these risks are required .
big data and advanced analytics are another technology-driven game changer for us growth .
as more data are generated , stored , and transmitted in digital form , new data sets relevant to personal and business decisions are growing exponentially .
as a result of advances in computing power , the advent of cloud computing , and new software tools , more of these data sets can be quickly analyzed and used by businesses to reduce costs , boost productivity , and create new products and services .
big data and advanced analytics can also reduce costs and enhance efficiency in health care and government , and can create value for consumers through greater product variety and quality , as well as enhanced convenience – benefits that are not captured in gdp statistics .
mckinsey estimates that big-data analytics could add about $325 billion , or 1 . 7% to annual gdp in the retail and manufacturing sectors , while generating up to $285 billion in productivity gains and cost savings in health care and government by 2020 .
the potential savings in health-care costs would ease pressures on government budgets and release resources to boost growth in the rest of the economy .
new information and communications technologies were game changers that boosted the potential growth rate of the us economy in the 1990’s .
mckinsey’s research suggests that shale energy and big-data technologies will be game changers with similar benefits for the economy’s potential growth over the next several years .
america’s opposing futures
i recently learned something interesting: american international finance economists and american domestically oriented macroeconomists have very different – indeed , opposing – views of the likely consequences of america’s huge current-account deficit .
international finance economists see a financial crisis as likely , followed by a painful and perhaps prolonged recession in the united states .
domestically oriented macroeconomists , by contrast , see a forthcoming fall in the value of the dollar not as a crisis , but as an opportunity to accelerate growth .
domestically oriented macroeconomists look at the situation roughly like this: at some point in the future , foreign central banks will become less willing to continue buying massive amounts of dollar-denominated securities in order to prop up the greenback .
when they cease their large-scale dollar-purchase programs , the value of the dollar will fall – and it will fall hard .
but , according to this view , as the dollar’s value declines , us exports will become more attractive to foreigners and american employment will rise , with labor re-allocated to the newly-vibrant export sector .
it will be like what happened in britain after it abandoned its exchange-rate peg and allowed the pound to depreciate relative to the deutschmark , or what happened in the us in the late 1980’s , when the dollar depreciated against the pound , the deutschmark , and – most importantly – the japanese yen .
international finance economists see a far bleaker future .
they see the end of large-scale dollar-purchase programs by central banks leading not only to a decline in the dollar , but also to a spike in us long-term interest rates , which will curb consumption spending immediately and throttle investment spending after only a short lag .
to be sure , international finance economists also see us exports benefiting as the value of the dollar declines , but the lags in demand are such that the export boost will come a year or two after the decline in consumption and investment spending .
eight to ten million people will have to shift employment from services and construction into exports and import-competing goods , implying that structural unemployment will rise .
moreover , there may be a financial panic: large financial institutions with short-term liabilities and long-term assets will have a difficult time weathering a large rise in long-term dollar-denominated interest rates .
this mismatch can cause financial stress and bankruptcy just as easily as banks’ local-currency assets and dollar liabilities caused stress and bankruptcy in the mexican and east asian crises of the 1990’s and in the argentinean crisis of this decade .
when international finance economists sketch this scenario , domestically oriented macroeconomists respond that it sounds like a case of incompetent monetary policy .
why should the federal reserve allow long-term interest rates to spike just because other central banks have ceased their dollar-purchase programs ?
should not the fed step in and replace them with its own purchases of long-term us treasury bonds , thereby keeping long-term interest rates at a level conducive to full employment ?
to this , international finance economists respond that the fed does not have the power to do so .
when forced to choose between full employment and price stability , the international finance economists say that the fed will choose price stability , because its institutional memory of the 1970’s , when inflation ran rampant , remains very strong .
therefore , since a fall in the value of the dollar raises import prices , and thus functions as a negative shock to the supply side of the economy , the fed will have to raise , not lower , interest rates , and sell , not buy , bonds .
serious economists whom i respect enormously find themselves taking strong positions on opposite sides of this debate .
i’m not wise enough to say which side is right , but i certainly know which side i hope is wrong .
america’s other 30%
new haven – the american consumer is but a shadow of its former almighty self .
personal consumption in the united states expanded at only a 1 . 5% annual rate in real ( inflation-adjusted ) terms in the second quarter of 2012 – and that was no aberration .
unfortunately , it continues a pattern of weakness that has been evident since early 2008 .
over the last 18 quarters , annualized growth in real consumer demand has averaged a mere 0 . 7% , compared to a 3 . 6% growth trend in the decade before the crisis erupted .
never before has the american consumer been this weak for this long .
the cause is no secret .
consumers made huge bets on two bubbles – housing and credit .
reckless monetary and regulatory policies turned the humble abode into an atm , allowing families to extract dollars from bubbles and live beyond their means .
both bubbles have long since burst , and us households are now dealing with post-bubble financial devastation – namely , underwater assets , record-high debt , and profound shortages of savings .
at the same time , sharply elevated unemployment and subpar income growth have combined to tighten the noose on over-extended consumers .
as a result , american households have hunkered down as never before .
consumers are diverting what little income they earn away from spending toward paying down debt and rebuilding savings .
that is both logical and rational – and thus not something that the us federal reserve can offset with unconventional monetary easing .
american consumers’ unprecedented retrenchment has turned the us economy’s growth calculus inside out .
consumption typically accounts for 70% of gdp ( 71% in the second quarter , to be precise ) .
but the 70% is barely growing , and is unlikely to expand strongly at any point in the foreseeable future .
that puts an enormous burden on the other 30% of the us economy to generate any sort of recovery .
in fact , the other 30% has not done a bad job , especially considering the severe headwinds coming from consumers’ 70% .
the 30% mainly consists of four components – capital spending by firms , net exports ( exports less imports ) , residential construction , and government purchases .
( technically , the pace of inventory investment should be included , but this is a cyclical buffer between production and sales rather than a source of final demand . )
given the 0 . 7% trend in real consumption growth over the past four and a half years , the us economy’s anemic 2 . 2% annualized recovery in the aftermath of the great recession is almost miraculous .
credit that mainly to the other 30% , especially to strong exports and a rebound in business capital spending .
by contrast , the government sector has been moving in the opposite direction , as state and local governments retrench and federal purchases top out after post-crisis deficit explosions .
the housing sector has started to recover over the past five quarters , but from such a severely depressed level that its growth has had little impact on the overall economy .
given the strong likelihood that consumers will remain weak for years to come , america’s growth agenda needs to focus on getting more out of the other 30% .
of the four growth components that fall into this category , two have the greatest potential to make a difference – capital spending and exports .
prospects for these two sources of growth will not only influence the vigor , or lack thereof , of any recovery; they could well be decisive in bringing about an important shift in the us growth model .
the 70/30 split underscores the challenge: the us must face up to a fundamental rebalancing – weaning itself from excessive reliance on internal demand and drawing greater support from external demand .
capital spending and exports , which together account for about 24% of gdp , hold the key to this shift .
at just over 10% of gdp , the share of capital spending is well below the peak of nearly 13% in 2000 .
but capital spending must exceed that peak if us businesses are to be equipped with state-of-the-art capacity , technology , and private infrastructure that will enable them to recapture market share at home and abroad .
only then could export growth , impressive since mid-2009 , sustain further increases .
and only then could the us stem the rising tide of import penetration by foreign producers .
the other 30% is also emblematic of a deeper strategic issue that america faces – a profound competitive challenge .
a shift to external demand is not there for the asking . it must be earned by hard work , sheer determination , and a long overdue competitive revival .
on that front , too , america has been falling behind .
according to the world economic forum’s global competitiveness index , the us slipped to fifth place in 2011-2012 , from fourth place the previous year , continuing a general downward trend evident since 2005 .
the erosion is traceable to several factors , including deficiencies in primary and secondary education as well as poor macroeconomic management .
but the us also has disturbingly low rankings in the quality of its infrastructure ( #24 ) , technology availability and absorption ( #18 ) , and the sophistication and breadth of its supply-chain production processes ( #14 ) .
improvement on all counts is vital for america’s competitive revival .
but meeting the challenge will require vigorous growth from america’s other 30% – especially private capital spending .
with the american consumer likely to remain on ice , the same 30% must also continue to shoulder the burden of a sluggish economic recovery .
none of this can occur in a vacuum .
the investment required for competitive revival and sustained recovery cannot be funded without a long-overdue improvement in us saving .
in an era of outsize government deficits and subpar household saving , that may be america’s toughest challenge of all .
america\u0027s other 87 deficits
new haven – the united states has a classic multilateral trade imbalance .
while it runs a large trade deficit with china , it also runs deficits with 87 other countries .
a multilateral deficit cannot be fixed by putting pressure on one of its bilateral components .
but try telling that to america’s growing chorus of china bashers .
america’s massive trade deficit is a direct consequence of an unprecedented shortfall of domestic saving .
the broadest and most meaningful measure of a country’s saving capacity is what economists call the “ net national saving rate ” – the combined saving of individuals , businesses , and the government .
it is measured in “ net ” terms to strip out the depreciation associated with aging or obsolescent capacity .
it provides a measure of the saving that is available to fund expansion of a country’s capital stock , and thus to sustain its economic growth .
in the us , there simply is no net saving any more .
since the fourth quarter of 2008 , america’s net national saving rate has been negative – in sharp contrast to the 6 . 4%-of-gdp averaged over the last three decades of the twentieth century .
never before in modern history has the world’s leading economic power experienced a saving shortfall of such epic proportions .
yet the us found a way to finesse this problem .
exploiting what&#160;valéry giscard d’estaing called the “ exorbitant privilege ” of the world’s reserve currency , the us borrowed surplus savings from abroad on very attractive terms , running massive balance-of-payments , or current-account , deficits to attract foreign capital .
the us current account , which was last in balance in 1991 , hit a record deficit of $801 billion ( 6% of gdp ) in 2006 .
this gap has narrowed in the past couple of years , but much of the improvement probably reflects little more than the temporary impact of an unusually tough business cycle .
this is where america’s multilateral trade deficit enters the equation , for it has long accounted for the bulk of america’s balance-of-payments gap .
since 2000 , it has made up fully 96% of the cumulative current-account shortfall .
and that is what ultimately makes the china-centric blame game so absurd .
without addressing the root of the problem – america’s chronic saving shortfall – it is ludicrous to believe that there can be a bilateral solution for a multilateral problem .
yet that is exactly what us officials , together with many prominent economists , believe america needs .
since the trade deficit is widely thought to put pressure on us jobs and real wages , the us-china trade imbalance has come under special scrutiny in these days of great angst .
yes , china does account for the largest component of america’s multilateral trade deficit – making up 42% of the total trade gap in 2010 .
conscious outsourcing and supply-chain management decisions by us multinationals play an important role in exaggerating china’s share .
but that does little to let china off the hook in the eyes of washington .
long-standing charges of currency manipulation provide the proverbial smoking gun that us politicians – of both parties –&#160;believe justifies the imposition of steep tariffs on china’s exports to the us ( which totaled $365 billion in 2010 ) .
that was precisely the argument behind the us senate’s recent overwhelming approval of a “ currency bill ” that took dead aim on china .
while it may be convenient to hold others accountable for america’s problems , this is bad economics driving bad politics .
in an era of open-ended us government budget deficits and chronic shortfalls in personal saving , america is doomed to suffer subpar savings and massive multilateral trade deficits for as far as the eye can see .
in that vein , closing down trade with china , while failing to address the saving shortfall , is like putting pressure on one end of a water balloon .
the chinese component of america’s multilateral trade deficit will simply migrate somewhere else – most likely to a higher-cost producer .
that would be the functional equivalent of a tax hike on beleaguered american families – hardly the solution that us politicians are promising .
this is not to ignore important us-china trade issues that need to be addressed .
market access should be high on the agenda – especially for a sluggish us economy that needs new sources of growth , like exports .
with china now america’s third largest – and by far its most rapidly growing – export market , the us should push hard to expand business opportunities in china , especially as the chinese economy tilts increasingly toward internal demand .
china should be viewed as an opportunity , not a threat .
at the same time , the us government should come clean with the american public about charges of chinese currency manipulation and unfair trade practices .
the renminbi has , in fact , appreciated by 30% relative to the us dollar since mid-2005 .
in broad multilateral terms – a far more meaningful gauge because it measures a currency’s value against a broad cross-section of a country’s trading partners – the “ real effective ” renminbi currently stands about 8% above its most recent 12-year average ( 1998-2010 ) .
yes , china continues to accumulate a vast fund of foreign-exchange reserves .
but this is as much the result of speculators’ “ hot money ” plays as it is a conscious and perfectly reasonable effort by chinese policymakers to remain focused on financial stability and manage currency appreciation in a gradual , disciplined , and orderly fashion .
china-bashing in the us speaks to a corrosive shift in the american psyche .
it deflects attention away from those truly responsible for perpetuating the greatest saving shortfall in history .
washington has been seduced by the political economy of false prosperity .
that seduction has encouraged america to squander its savings and live beyond its means for nearly two decades .
now the game is up .
the ultimate test of any nation’s character is to look inside itself at moments of great challenge . swept up in the blame game , the us is doing the opposite .
and that could well be the greatest tragedy of all .
after all , america’s 88 deficits did not arise of thin air .
the american consumer is not okay
new haven – the spin-doctors are hard at work talking up america’s subpar economic recovery .
all eyes are on households .
thanks to falling unemployment , rising home values , and record stock prices , an emerging consensus of forecasters , market participants , and policymakers has now concluded that the american consumer is finally back .
don’t believe it .
first , consider the facts: over the 21 quarters since the beginning of 2008 , real ( inflation-adjusted ) personal consumption has risen at an average annual rate of just 0 . 9% .
that is by far the most protracted period of weakness in real us consumer demand since the end of world war ii – and a massive slowdown from the pre-crisis pace of 3 . 6% annual real consumption growth from 1996 to 2007 .
with household consumption accounting for about 70% of the us economy , that 2 . 7-percentage-point gap between pre-crisis and post-crisis trends has been enough to knock 1 . 9 percentage points off the post-crisis trend in real gdp growth .
look no further for the cause of unacceptably high us unemployment .
to appreciate fully the unique character of this consumer-demand shortfall , trends over the past 21 quarters need to be broken down into two distinct sub-periods .
first , there was a 2 . 2% annualized decline from the first quarter of 2008 through the second quarter of 2009 .
this was crisis-driven carnage , highlighted by a 4 . 5% annualized collapse in the final two quarters of 2008 .
second , this six-quarter plunge was followed , from mid-2009 through early 2013 , by 15 quarters of annualized consumption growth averaging just 2% – an upturn that pales in comparison with what would have been expected based on past consumer-spending cycles .
that key point appears all but lost on the consumer-recovery crowd .
in recent speeches and discussions with current and former central bankers , i have been criticized for focusing too much on the 0 . 9% trend of the past 21 quarters and paying too little attention to the 2% recovery phase of the post-crisis period .
at least it’s a recovery , they claim , and a sign of healing that can be attributed mainly to the heroic , unconventional efforts of the us federal reserve .
this brings us to the second part of the argument against optimism: analytics .
one of the first concepts to which an economics student is exposed in a basic macro course is “ pent-up ” consumer demand .
discretionary consumption is typically deferred during recessions , especially for long-lasting durable goods such as motor vehicles , furniture , and appliances .
once the recession ends and recovery begins , a “ stock-adjustment ” response takes hold , as households compensate for foregone replacement and update their aging durable goods .
over most of the postwar period , this post-recession release of pent-up consumer demand has been a powerful source of support for economic recovery .
in the eight recoveries since the early 1950’s ( excluding the brief pop following the credit-controls-induced slump in the 1980’s ) , the stock-adjustment response lifted real consumption growth by 6 . 1% , on average , for five quarters following business-cycle downturns; spurts of 7-8% growth were not uncommon for a quarter or two .
by contrast , the release of pent-up demand in the current cycle amounted to just 3% annualized growth in the five quarters from early 2010 to early 2011 .
moreover , the strongest quarterly gain was a 4 . 1% increase in the fourth quarter of 2010 .
this is a stunning result .
the worst consumer recession in modern history , featuring a record collapse in durable-goods expenditures in 2008-2009 , should have triggered an outsize surge of pent-up demand .
yet it did anything but that .
instead , the release of pent-up consumer demand was literally half that of previous business cycles .
the third point is more diagnostic: the shockingly anemic pattern of post-crisis us consumer demand has resulted from a deep japan-like balance-sheet recession .
with the benefit of hindsight , we now know that the 12-year pre-crisis us consumer-spending binge was built on a precarious foundation of asset and credit bubbles .
when those bubbles burst , consumers were left with a massive overhang of excess debt and subpar saving .
the post-bubble aversion to spending , and the related focus on balance-sheet repair , reflects what nomura research institute economist richard koo has called a powerful “ debt rejection ” syndrome .
while koo applied this framework to japanese firms in japan’s first lost decade of the 1990’s , it rings true for america’s crisis-battered consumers , who are still struggling with the lingering pressures of excessive debt loads , underwater mortgages , and woefully inadequate personal saving .
through its unconventional monetary easing , the fed is attempting to create a shortcut around the imperative of household sector balance-sheet repair .
this is where the wealth effects of now-rebounding housing prices and a surging stock market come into play .
but are these newfound wealth effects really all that they are made out to be ?
yes , the stock market is now at an all-time high – but only in current dollars .
in real terms , the s&amp;p 500 is still 20% below its january 2000 peak .
similarly , while the case-shiller index of us home prices is now up 10 . 2% over the year ending march 2013 , it remains 28% below its 2006 peak .
wealth creation matters , but not until it recoups the wealth destruction that preceded it .
sadly , most american households are still far from recovery on the asset side of their balance sheets .
moreover , though the us unemployment rate has fallen , this largely reflects an alarming decline in labor-force participation , with more than 6 . 5 million americans since 2006 having given up looking for work .
at the same time , while consumer confidence is on the mend , it remains well below pre-crisis readings .
in short , the american consumer’s nightmare is far from over .
spin and frothy markets aside , the healing has only just begun .
america’s political recession
berkeley – the odds are now about 36% that the united states will be in a recession next year .
the reason is entirely political: partisan polarization has reached levels never before seen , threatening to send the us economy tumbling over the “ fiscal cliff ” – the automatic tax increases and spending cuts that will take effect at the beginning of 2013 unless democrats and republicans agree otherwise .
more than a century ago , during the first gilded age , american politics was sharply polarized as well .
in 1896 , future president theodore roosevelt was a republican attack dog .
he denounced democratic presidential candidate william jennings bryan as a mere puppet of the sinister governor of illinois , john peter altgeld .
bryan , roosevelt said ,  “ would be as clay in the hands of the potter under the astute control of the ambitious and unscrupulous illinois communist . ”
the “ free coinage of silver ” would be “ but a step towards the general socialism which is the fundamental doctrine of his political belief . ”
he and altgeld “ seek to overturn the . . . essential policies which have controlled the government since its foundation . ”
such language is as extreme as any we hear today – and from a man who was shortly to become vice president ( and later president , following the assassination of william mckinley ) .
we have heard texas governor rick perry call obliquely for the lynching of his fellow republican , federal reserve chairman ben bernanke , should he come to the lone star state .
and we have seen kansas secretary of state kris kobach explore the possibility of removing president barack obama from the ballot in kansas , because , kobach suggested , obama is “ not a natural-born citizen . ”
but neither perry nor kobach is likely ever to be a us president , whereas theodore roosevelt was more than a partisan .
he was happy to make deals with democrats – to put himself at the head not just of the republican party but of the bipartisan progressive coalition , trying either to yoke the two forces together or to tack back and forth between them to achieve legislative and policy goals .
obama broadly follows ronald reagan’s ( second-term ) security policy , george h . w . bush’s spending policy , bill clinton’s tax policy , the bipartisan squam lake group’s financial-regulatory policy , perry’s immigration policy , john mccain’s climate-change policy , and mitt romney’s health-care policy ( at least when romney was governor of massachusetts ) .
and yet he has gotten next to no republicans to support their own policies .
indeed , like clinton before him , obama has been unable to get republican senators like susan collins to vote for her own campaign-finance policies , mccain to vote for his own climate-change policy , and – most laughably – romney to support his own health-care plan .
likewise , he has been unable to get republican vice-presidential candidate paul ryan to endorse his own medicare cost-control proposals .
there are obvious reasons for this .
a large chunk of the republican base , including many of the party’s largest donors , believes that any democratic president is an illegitimate enemy of america , so that whatever such an incumbent proposes must be wrong and thus should be thwarted .
and the republican cadres believe this of obama even more than they believed it of clinton .
this view clearly influences republican office-holders , who fear the partisan beast that mans their campaigns’ phone banks and holds the purse strings .
moreover , ever since clinton’s election in 1992 , those at the head of the republican party have believed that creating gridlock whenever a democrat is in the white house , and thus demonstrating the government’s incapacity to act , is their best path to electoral success .
that was the republicans’ calculation in 2011-2012 .
and november’s election did not change the balance of power anywhere in the american government: obama remains president , the republicans remain in control of the house of representatives , and the democrats control the senate .
now , it is possible that republican legislators may rebel against their leaders , arguing that they ran for office to govern , not to paralyze the government in the hope that doing so will give the party power to reign as it wishes after the next election .
it is possible that republican leaders like representatives john boehner and eric cantor and senator mitch mcconnell will conclude that their policy of obstruction has been a failure .
they might note that , although the economy remains deeply troubled and depressed in the aftermath of a financial crisis for which they set the stage , obama’s policies have been by far the most successful of those in any major advanced country , and conclude that he has been a relatively good president , and one worth supporting .
but don’t count on it .
right now , every senior politician in america is telling their favorites in the press that they are confident that compromise on the “ fiscal cliff ” will be reached before the end of december .
but they are telling their favorites this because they think that pessimism now will lead to their being blamed for gridlock later .
it seems to me that the odds are around 60% that real negotiation will not begin until tax rates go up on january 1 .
and it seems to me that , if gridlock continues into 2013 , the odds are 60% that it will tip the us back into recession .
let us hope that it will be short and shallow .
bye-bye , middle east ?
paris – for some time now , a certain strategic vision has been gaining traction: the united states is becoming energy-independent , paving the way for its political retreat from the middle east and justifying its strategic “ pivot ” toward asia .
this view seems intuitively correct , but is it ?
energy-hungry america has long depended on the global market to meet domestic demand .
in 2005 , the us imported 60% of the energy that it consumed .
since then , however , the share of imports has decreased , and it should continue to do so .
the us is expected to become energy self-sufficient in 2020 , and to become an oil exporter by 2030 .
this scenario would grant the us three enormous advantages .
it would enhance us economic competitiveness , especially relative to europe , given the lower costs involved in the extraction of shale gas .
it would also reduce america’s exposure to growing unrest in the arab world .
finally , it would increase the relative vulnerability of america’s main strategic rival , china , which is becoming increasingly dependent on middle east energy supplies .
these facts obviously need to be taken seriously , but their implications for us foreign policy in the middle east should not be too hastily drawn .
above all , though energy dependence is a key element of us policy in the region , it is far from being the only factor .
israel’s security and the desire to contain iran are equally important .
moreover , the middle east’s role in the global geopolitics of energy will grow in the coming decades , making it difficult to see how a superpower like the us could simply walk away from the region .
within the next 15 years , opec countries will account for 50% of global oil production , compared to only 42% today .
furthermore , the country on which this increase will most likely hinge is iraq .
could the us ignore a country that in roughly ten years will become the world’s second-largest oil exporter , generating more than $200 billion annually in revenue , while increasingly being dominated by an authoritarian shia regime that is close to iran ?
would it withdraw in the face of the consequent strategic threat to its three allies – saudi arabia , turkey , and israel – in the region ?
such a possibility seems even more far-fetched as long as the iranian nuclear crisis remains unresolved and the syrian crisis continues to widen the region’s shia-sunni divide ( reflected in increased tension between turkey and iran ) .
even as us president barack obama was visiting asia in november – a trip meant to underscore america’s “ pivot ” – he was forced to devote considerable time and attention to mediating a cease-fire between israel and hamas in gaza .
indeed , if oil were truly america’s only or paramount interest in the middle east , its special relationship with israel would be mystifying , given the harm that it implies for us interests among arab oil exporters .
even when its energy dependence on the middle east was at its peak , the us rarely altered its policy of support for israel .
it is also important to bear in mind that in 1973 , the us suffered less from the opec oil embargo than europe did , even though america , which had resupplied israel in its war with egypt and syria in october of that year , was the primary target .
in the end , america’s position in the region strengthened after egypt became a us ally and made peace with israel .
china’s growing interest in the middle east also decreases the likelihood of an american withdrawal .
the us will remain concerned about ensuring the security of energy supplies for its asian allies , which , like china , are increasingly dependent on the region’s oil exporters .
nevertheless , while an american withdrawal from the middle east seems highly unlikely , us exposure to the region will indeed decline; as that happens , america’s role there will probably become more subdued – and perhaps more cynical .
its involvement in the israeli-palestinian conflict will likely be limited to maintaining the status quo rather than seeking a comprehensive settlement .
this stance – suggested by america’s opposition to granting palestine observer-state status at the united nations – would amount to an admission by the us that it has given up on the creation of two states in the middle east .
that would certainly satisfy israeli prime minister binyamin netanyahu and the palestinian fringe seeking to weaken the palestinian authority .
but it would fully vindicate those who believe that obama is more a man of good will than a visionary .
america’s perpetual christmas
has the united states transcended the laws of economics ?
as the new year begins , the us continues to race ahead of its rich-country counterparts .
the gargantuan us trade deficit ?
no problem .
in 2005 , it widened further , and the dollar only strengthened .
low investment and a deteriorating primary education system ?
not to worry .
the super-flexible us economy keeps managing to produce more with less .
nor are there any signs of america’s economic hegemony starting to fold under the weight of maintaining its unilateral military dominance .
instead of feeling the pinch of wartime privations , like in any ordinary country , american consumers are binging as if it were christmas all year round .
there are those who truly believe in the idea that america is exceptional .
those true believers argue that america’s consumers can long pursue their spendthrift ways because their country’s economy is better than everyone else’s .
the us labor market is more flexible than europe’s , enabling it to react more nimbly to the ever shifting sands of globalization .
and , unlike most countries , especially in latin america and asia , the us system ruthlessly prunes weak corporate leadership .
moreover , the true believers cite america’s better-funded and hyper-competitive university system , which sucks in a disproportionate share of the world’s top students and researchers .
many ultimately choose to immigrate to america permanently , and it is relatively easy for them to do so , thanks to a society that still welcomes outsiders with open arms ( even if things have become more difficult since 2001 ) .
on top of all this , the us military , rather than being a burden , feeds the country’s technological superiority by subsidizing basic research .
by contrast , skeptics hold that the us economy already contains the seeds of its own socio-economic decline .
they point to worsening income inequality , as images beamed worldwide from post-hurricane new orleans illustrated all too clearly .
poor children do not have reasonable access to health care .
nor are the non-poor faring particularly well , as wage growth has remained virtually flat for a very long time , even as corporate profits are booming .
indeed , this disconnect may explain why polls do not give president bush the credit for economic management that his strong record would seem to merit . nor does it help americans’ mood that they spend far more of their lives working than do citizens in europe or , these days , even japan .
all of these factors place deep stresses on the social fabric which , so the skeptics argue , will ultimately play out in the political arena .
interestingly , both sides cite america’s gaping trade deficit – believe it or not , the us is soaking up two-thirds of global excess saving – to support their arguments .
the true believers view the deficits as evidence that the world recognizes how special the us is and wants to buy in . skeptics see an empire living on borrowed money and borrowed time .
so which is it ?
in my view , those who think that america is about to collapse are likely to be disappointed .
nevertheless , i suspect that the age of american exceptionalism is near an end , and soon per capita income in europe and japan will approach that of the us , rather than falling farther behind .
though the next few years are likely to underscore some of the weaknesses that the skeptics highlight , the end will come mainly because other countries will find creative ways to mimic the most effective us institutions , albeit within their own legal , political , and social frameworks .
we would do well to recall how , at the beginning of the 1990’s , book after book was still being written urging us and european corporations to imitate japan or face certain doom .
the last 15 years have of course revealed deep flaws in japan’s financial system .
but another major factor contributing to japan’s decline was that firms elsewhere began adopting japanese methods , such as just-in-time supply chains .
surely , imitation will someday impinge on superior us growth performance as well .
perhaps the biggest weakness in the true believers’ argument is the trade deficit .
for the moment , america’s ability to borrow vast sums at low interest rates acts like a huge dose of steroids on the economy . it artificially props up consumption growth and allows the government to defer hard choices between taxes and military expenditures .
at some point , the party is going to end .
the unwinding of the us economy might even begin in 2006 , particularly if japan continues to grow out of its doldrums , the us housing market softens dramatically , and europe’s economic recovery accelerates .
individually , these are each highly plausible scenarios , and collectively they would hit the us trade deficit like a perfect storm .
perhaps the end will come in a different way , but it is difficult to imagine the age of us exceptionalism lasting indefinitely .
can the end come abruptly in 2006 ?
this is not the most likely scenario , but it is not unthinkable .
america’s strategy vacuum
new haven – apparently , policymakers at the federal reserve are having second thoughts about the wisdom of open-ended quantitative easing ( qe ) .
they should .
not only has this untested policy experiment failed to deliver an acceptable economic recovery; it has also heightened the risk of another crisis .
the minutes of the january 29-30 meeting of the fed’s federal open market committee ( fomc ) speak to a simmering discontent: “ [ m ] any participants…expressed some concerns about potential costs and risks arising from further asset purchases . ”
the concerns range from worries about the destabilizing ramifications of an exit strategy from qe to apprehension about capital losses on the fed’s rapidly ballooning portfolio of securities ( currently $3 trillion , and on its way to $4 trillion by the end of this year ) .
as serious as these concerns may be , they overlook what could well be the greatest flaw in the fed’s unprecedented gambit: an emphasis on short-term tactics over longer-term strategy .
blindsided by the crisis of 2007-2008 , the fed has compounded its original misdiagnosis of the problem by repeatedly doubling down on tactical responses , with two rounds of qe preceding the current , open-ended iteration .
the fomc , drawing a false sense of comfort from the success of qe1 – a massive liquidity injection in the depths of a horrific crisis – mistakenly came to believe that it had found the right template for subsequent policy actions .
that approach might have worked had the us economy been afflicted by a cyclical disease – a temporary shortfall of aggregate demand .
in that case , countercyclical policies – both fiscal and monetary – could eventually be expected to plug the demand hole and get the economy going again , just as keynesians argue .
but the us is not suffering from a temporary , cyclical malady . it is afflicted by a very different disease: a protracted balance-sheet recession that continues to hobble american households , whose consumption accounts for roughly 70% of gdp .
two bubbles – property and credit – against which american families borrowed freely , have long since burst .
but the aftershocks linger: household-debt loads were still at 113% of disposable personal income in 2012 ( versus 75% in the final three decades of the twentieth century ) , and the personal-saving rate averaged just 3 . 9% last year ( compared to 7 . 9% from 1970 to 1999 ) .
understandably fixated on balance-sheet repair , us consumers have not taken the bait from their monetary and fiscal authorities .
instead , they have cut back on spending .
gains in inflation-adjusted personal-consumption expenditure have averaged a mere 0 . 8% over the past five years – the most severe and protracted slowdown in consumer demand growth in the post-world war ii era .
the brute force of massive monetary and fiscal stimulus rings hollow as a cyclical remedy to this problem .
another approach is needed .
the focus , instead , should be on accelerating the process of balance-sheet repair , while at the same time returning monetary and fiscal policy levers to more normal settings .
forgiveness of “ underwater ” mortgages ( where the outstanding loan exceeds the home’s current market value ) , as well as reducing the foreclosure overhang of some 1 . 5 million homes , must be part of that solution .
how else can the crisis-battered housing market finally clear for the remainder of us homeowners ?
the same can be said for enhanced saving incentives , which would contribute to longer-term financial security for american households , most of which suffered massive wealth losses in the great recession .
expanded individual retirement accounts and 401k pension schemes , special incentives for low-income households ( most of which have no retirement plans ) , and an end to the financial repression that the fed’s zero-interest-rate policy imposes on savers must also be part of the solution .
yes , these are controversial policies .
debt forgiveness raises thorny ethical concerns about condoning reckless and irresponsible behavior .
but converting underwater “ non-recourse ” mortgage loans , where only the house is at risk , into so-called “ recourse liabilities , ” for which nonpayment would have consequences for all of a borrower’s assets , could address this concern , while simultaneously tempering america’s culture of leverage with a much greater sense of responsibility .
timing is also an issue , especially with respect to saving incentives .
to avoid the shortfall in aggregate demand that might arise from an abrupt surge in saving , these measures should be phased in over a period of 3-5 years .
the main benefit of these proposals is that they are more strategic than tactical – better aligned with the balance-sheet problems that are actually afflicting the economy .
as the quintessential laissez-faire system , the us has outsourced strategy to the invisible hand of the market for far too long .
that has left the government locked into a reactive and often misguided approach to unexpected problems .
thus , the fed is focused on cleaning up after a crisis rather than on how to avoid another one .
the same is true of us fiscal policy , with an event-driven debate that now has ever-shorter time horizons: the fiscal cliff on january 1 , sequestration of expenditures on march 1 , expiration of the continuing budget resolution on march 27 , and the new may 18 debt-ceiling limit .
a compliant bond market , which may well be the next bubble , is mistakenly viewed as the ultimate validation of this myopic approach .
the dangers of america’s strategy vacuum and the related penchant for short-termism have been mounting for some time .
harvard business school professor michael porter famously raised this concern in a 1996 article in the harvard business review .
his focus was on corporate decision-making and misaligned incentives leading to a worrisome dichotomy between the short-term tactics of “ operational effectiveness ”  ( cost cutting , outsourcing , and reengineering ) and the long-term visionary bets that frame successful strategies .
while porter’s critique was directed at business managers , it bears critically on the current us policy debate .
a successful long-term strategy cannot be seen as a succession of short-term fixes .
the internal debate in the fomc represents a healthy and long-overdue recognition that the central bank may be digging itself into an ever-deeper hole by committing to misguided policies aimed at the wrong problem .
a comparable debate is raging over fiscal policy .
can america finally face up to the perils of its strategy vacuum ?
america’s political class struggle
new york – america is on a collision course with itself .
this month’s deal between president barack obama and the republicans in congress to extend the tax cuts initiated a decade ago by president george w . bush is being hailed as the start of a new bipartisan consensus . i believe , instead , that it is a false truce in what will become a pitched battle for the soul of american politics .
as in many countries , conflicts over public morality and national strategy come down to questions of money . in the united states , this is truer than ever .
the us is running an annual budget deficit of around $1 trillion , which may widen further as a result of the new tax agreement .
this level of annual borrowing is far too high for comfort . it must be cut , but how ?
the problem is america’s corrupted politics and loss of civic morality .
one political party , the republicans , stands for little except tax cuts , which they place above any other goal .
the democrats have a bit wider set of interests , including support for health care , education , training , and infrastructure .
but , like the republicans , the democrats , too , are keen to shower tax cuts on their major campaign contributors , predominantly rich americans .
the result is a dangerous paradox .
the us budget deficit is enormous and unsustainable .
the poor are squeezed by cuts in social programs and a weak job market .
one in eight americans depends on food stamps to eat .
yet , despite these circumstances , one political party wants to gut tax revenues altogether , and the other is easily dragged along , against its better instincts , out of concern for keeping its rich contributors happy .
this tax-cutting frenzy comes , incredibly , after three decades of elite fiscal rule in the us that has favored the rich and powerful .
since ronald reagan became president in 1981 , america’s budget system has been geared to supporting the accumulation of vast wealth at the top of the income distribution .
amazingly , the richest 1% of american households now has a higher net worth than the bottom 90% .
the annual income of the richest 12 , 000 households is greater than that of the poorest 24 million households .
the republican party’s real game is to try to lock that income and wealth advantage into place .
they fear , rightly , that sooner or later everyone else will begin demanding that the budget deficit be closed in part by raising taxes on the rich .
after all , the rich are living better than ever , while the rest of american society is suffering .
it makes sense to tax them more .
the republicans are out to prevent that by any means .
this month , they succeeded , at least for now .
but they want to follow up their tactical victory – which postpones the restoration of pre-bush tax rates for a couple of years – with a longer-term victory next spring .
their leaders in congress are already declaring that they will slash public spending in order to begin reducing the deficit .
ironically , there is one area in which large budget cuts are certainly warranted: the military .
but that is the one item most republicans won’t touch .
they want to slash the budget not by ending the useless war in afghanistan , and by eliminating unnecessary weapons systems , but by cutting education , health , and other benefits for the poor and working class .
in the end , i don’t think they will succeed .
for the moment , most americans seem to be going along with republican arguments that it is better to close the budget deficit through spending cuts rather than tax increases .
yet when the actual budget proposals are made , there will be a growing backlash .
with their backs against the wall , i predict , poor and working-class americans will begin to agitate for social justice .
this may take time .
the level of political corruption in america is staggering .
everything now is about money to run electoral campaigns , which have become incredibly expensive .
the mid-term elections cost an estimated $4 . 5 billion , with most of the contributions coming from big corporations and rich contributors .
these powerful forces , many of which operate anonymously under us law , are working relentlessly to defend those at the top of the income distribution .
but make no mistake: both parties are implicated .
there is already talk that obama will raise $1 billion or more for his re-election campaign .
that sum will not come from the poor .
the problem for the rich is that , other than military spending , there is no place to cut the budget other than in areas of core support for the poor and working class .
is america really going to cut health benefits and retirement income ?   will it really balance the budget by slashing education spending at a time when us students already are being out-performed by their asian counterparts ?
will america really let its public infrastructure continue to deteriorate ?
the rich will try to push such an agenda , but ultimately they will fail .
obama swept to power on the promise of change .
so far there has been none .
his administration is filled with wall street bankers .
his top officials leave to join the banks , as his budget director peter orszag recently did .
he is always ready to serve the interests of the rich and powerful , with no line in the sand , no limit to “ compromise . ”
if this continues , a third party will emerge , committed to cleaning up american politics and restoring a measure of decency and fairness .
this , too , will take time .
the political system is deeply skewed against challenges to the two incumbent parties .
yet the time for change will come .
the republicans believe that they have the upper hand and can pervert the system further in favor of the rich . i believe that they will be proved wrong .
america\u0027s problems run deeper than wall street
cambridge – with less than two months remaining before america’s presidential election , much attention is focused on the state of the american economy and the challenges that it will present to the next president .
we are in the midst of a financial crisis caused by the serious mispricing of all kinds of risks and by the collapse of the housing bubble that developed in the first half of this decade .
what started as a problem with sub-prime mortgages has now spread to houses more generally , as well as to other asset classes .
the housing problem is contributing to the financial crisis , which in turn is reducing the supply of credit needed to sustain economic activity .
indeed , the financial crisis has worsened in recent weeks , reflected in the us federal reserve’s takeover of quasi-government mortgage lenders fannie mae and freddie mac – which may cost american taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars – as well as the bankruptcy of lehman brothers and the sale of merrill lynch .
ultimately , these financial failures reflect the downward spiral of house prices and the increasing number of homes with negative equity , i . e . , with substantial mortgage debt in excess of market values .
negative equity is significant because mortgages in the united states are generally “ no recourse ” loans .
if a homeowner defaults , creditors can take the house , but they cannot take other property or income to make up any unpaid balance .
even in those states where mortgages are not “ no recourse ” loans , creditors generally do not pursue the assets or income of individuals who default .
we cannot be sure about how much further house prices will fall .
experts say another 15% decline is required just to return to the pre-bubble price path .
but there is nothing to stop the decline from continuing once it reaches that point .
the growing gap between mortgage debts and house prices will continue to increase the rate of defaults .
many homeowners who can afford to make their mortgage payments will choose to default , move to rental housing , and wait to purchase until house prices have declined further .
as homeowners with large negative equity default , the foreclosed homes contribute to the excess supply that drives prices down further .
and the lower prices lead to more negative equity and therefore to more defaults and foreclosures .
it is not clear what will stop this self-reinforcing process .
declining house prices are key to the financial crisis and the outlook for the economy , because mortgage-backed securities , and the derivatives based on them , are the primary assets that are weakening financial institutions .
until house prices stabilize , these securities cannot be valued with any confidence .
and that means that the financial institutions that own them cannot have confidence in the liquidity or solvency of potential counterparties – or even in the value of their own capital .
without this confidence , credit will not flow and economic activity will be constrained .
moreover , because financial institutions’ assets were bought mainly with borrowed money , the shortage of credit is exacerbated by their need to deleverage .
since raising capital is difficult and costly , they deleverage by lending less .
but the macroeconomic weakness in the us now goes beyond the decreased supply of credit .   falling house prices reduce household wealth and therefore consumer spending .
falling employment lowers wage and salary incomes .
the higher prices of food and energy depress real incomes further .
and declining economic activity in the rest of the world is lowering demand for us exports .
the us federal reserve has , in my judgment , responded appropriately by reducing the federal funds interest rate sharply and creating a variety of new credit facilities .
the low interest rate helped by making the dollar more competitive , but otherwise monetary policy appears to have lost traction because of the condition of the housing sector and the dysfunctional state of the credit markets .
the us congress and the bush administration enacted a $100 billion tax rebate in an attempt to stimulate consumer spending .
those of us who supported this policy generally knew that history and economic theory implied that such one-time fiscal transfers have little effect , but we thought that this time might be different .
our support was , in the words of samuel johnson , a triumph of hope over experience .
in the end , our hopes were frustrated .
the official national income accounting data for the second quarter are now available , and they show that the rebates did very little to stimulate spending .
more than 80% of the rebate dollars were saved or used to pay down debt .
very little was added to current spending .
so that is where the us is now: in the middle of a financial crisis , with the economy sliding into recession , monetary policy already at maximum easing , and fiscal transfers impotent .
that is an unenviable situation , to say the least , for any incoming president .
obama’s burmese gamble
arlington – the rapprochement between the united states and myanmar ( burma ) has proceeded at a blistering pace .
a year ago , the two countries did not even have ambassadors in each other’s capitals .
in may , president thein sein became the first leader from myanmar to visit the white house in nearly a half-century .
but has barack obama’s administration been too quick to embrace what was , until recently , one of the world’s most repressive regimes ?
or , on the contrary , is decisive us support essential to myanmar’s fledgling reform process ?
until the recent opening , myanmar , which gained independence in 1948 , had been ruled by a secretive military junta since 1962 .
as recently as 2010 , the regime held elections so blatantly rigged that the main opposition party refused to participate .
but in 2011 , shortly before assuming the presidency , sein , a general who served as prime minister under the junta , began to take steps that impressed even the most skeptical observers .
unlike the token gestures of reform offered by previous rulers , sein’s actions appeared substantive and meaningful .
one important change was the release of hundreds of political prisoners , including the regime’s most prominent opponent , aung san suu kyi , who had been under house arrest for nearly 15 years .
moreover , sein initiated a dialogue with suu kyi , a nobel peace prize winner and the leader of the national league for democracy ( nld ) , about a transition to civilian rule .
the subsequent elections bolstered hope for myanmar’s democratic future .
in 1990 , when the nld won 81% of the seats in parliament , the junta promptly voided the results and arrested suu kyi .
in 2012 , the nld won 43 of the 44 seats that it contested , and the military accepted suu kyi as the reform movement’s legitimate leader .
furthermore , sein has reached out to the karen , kachin , and other ethnic minorities – groups whose members have suffered decades of official persecution and mistreatment .
and efforts to open myanmar’s economy to international trade have transformed the country’s commercial capital , yangon ( rangoon ) , with businesspeople now arriving on direct flights from at least a half-dozen foreign capitals and once-empty streets now congested with imported cars .
but , in some areas , reform has been painfully slow .
in fact , when it comes to human rights and minority protections , myanmar may even be regressing .
the liberalization process has exposed the country’s long-standing religious divisions , leading to a wave of sectarian violence aimed primarily at the minority muslim community .
from coastal rakhine to inland towns like meiktila and tatkon , buddhist monks have incited violence against muslims ( and sometimes vice versa ) , with local officials often tacitly permitting religious bloodletting .
at his meeting with sein in washington , dc , obama condemned the violence against myanmar’s muslims , which has displaced many of them .
on the same day , the us state department released its annual report on religious freedom , in which myanmar was included among the world’s eight worst offenders .
this has not always been the case .
although myanmar is an overwhelmingly buddhist country , dozens of religious and ethnic communities have long lived there side by side .
in the heart of yangon , the golden dome of the sule pagoda stands just across the street from the minarets of the bengali mosque .
in order to achieve the peace and stability needed to consolidate myanmar’s democratic transition , both sein and suu kyi should do more to establish themselves as representatives of all of myanmar’s citizens .
muslims need to be assured of their personal security and guaranteed full civil rights .
the obama administration has staked significant political capital on the wager that myanmar’s promise may finally bear fruit .
and , indeed , the rate of change in myanmar over the last two years has been nothing short of remarkable .
but , as sein acknowledged at the white house , myanmar’s government “ has been encountering obstacles and challenges along [ its ] democratization process . ”
how it copes with these problems – and those that have yet to arise – will determine whether america has given its blessing prematurely .
america\u0027s renminbi fixation
new york – for seven years , the united states has allowed its fixation on the renminbi’s exchange rate to deflect attention from far more important issues in its economic relationship with china .
the upcoming strategic and economic dialogue between the us and china is an excellent opportunity to examine – and rethink – america’s priorities .
since 2005 , the us congress has repeatedly flirted with legislation aimed at defending hard-pressed american workers from the presumed threat of a cheap chinese currency .
bipartisan support for such a measure surfaced when senators charles schumer ( a liberal democrat from new york ) and lindsey graham ( a conservative republican from south carolina ) introduced the first chinese currency bill .
the argument for legislative action is tantalizingly simple: the us merchandise trade deficit has averaged a record 4 . 4% of gdp since 2005 , with china accounting for fully 35% of the shortfall , supposedly owing to its currency manipulation .
the chinese , insists a broad coalition of politicians , business leaders , and academic economists , must revalue or face sanctions .
this reasoning resonates with the us public .
opinion polls conducted in 2011 found that fully 61% of americans believes that china represents a serious economic threat .
as such , the currency debate looms as a major issue in the upcoming us presidential campaign .
“ enough is enough , ” president barack obama replied , when queried on the renminbi in the aftermath of his last meeting with chinese president hu jintao .
obama’s presumptive republican challenger , mitt romney , has promised to declare china guilty of currency manipulation the day he takes office .
but , however appealing this logic may be , it is wrong .
first , america’s trade deficit is multilateral: the us ran deficits with 88 nations in 2010 .
a multilateral imbalance – especially one that it is traceable to a saving shortfall – cannot be fixed by putting pressure on a bilateral exchange rate .
indeed , america’s major threat is from within .
blaming china merely impedes the heavy lifting that must be done at home – namely , boosting saving by cutting budget deficits and encouraging households to save income rather than rely on asset bubbles .
second , the renminbi has now appreciated 31 . 4% against the dollar since mid-2005 , well in excess of the 27 . 5% increase called for by the original schumer-graham bill .
mindful of the lessons of japan – especially its disastrous concession on sharp yen appreciation in the plaza accord of 1985 – the chinese have opted , instead , for a gradual revaluation .
recent moves toward renminbi internationalization , a more open capital account , and wider currency trading bands leave little doubt that the endgame is a market-based , fully convertible renminbi .
third , there has been significant improvement in china’s external imbalance .
the international monetary fund estimates that china’s current-account surplus will narrow to just 2 . 3% of gdp in 2012 , after peaking at 10 . 1% in 2007 .
american officials have long bemoaned china’s saving glut as a major source of global instability .
but they should look in the mirror: america’s current-account deficit this year , at an estimated $510 billion , is likely to be 2 . 8 times higher than china’s surplus .
finally , china has evolved from the world’s factory to its assembly line .
research shows that no more than 20% to 30% of chinese exports to the us reflect value added inside china .
roughly 60% of chinese exports represent shipments of “ foreign invested enterprises ” – in effect , chinese subsidiaries of global multinationals .
think apple .
globalized production platforms distort bilateral trade data between the us and china , and have little to do with the exchange rate .
rather than vilifying china as the principal economic threat to america , the relationship should be recast as an opportunity .
the largest component of us aggregate demand – the consumer – is on ice .
with households focused on repairing severely damaged balance sheets , inflation-adjusted private consumption has expanded at an anemic 0 . 5% average annual rate over the past four years .
consumer deleveraging is likely to persist for years to come , leaving the us increasingly desperate for new sources of growth .
exports top the list of possibilities .
china is now america’s third largest and most rapidly growing export market .
there can be no mistaking its potential to fill some of the void left by us consumers .
the key to realizing that opportunity lies in access to chinese markets – all the more significant in light of china’s upcoming pro-consumption rebalancing .
historically , china has had an open development model , with imports running at 28% of gdp since 2002 – nearly three times japan’s 10% import ratio during its high-growth era ( 1960-1989 ) .
as a result , for a given increment of domestic demand , china is far more predisposed toward foreign sourcing .
as the chinese consumer emerges , demand for a wide variety of us-made goods – ranging from new-generation information technology and biotech to automotive components and aircraft – could surge .
the same is true of services .
at just 43% of gdp , china’s services sector is relatively tiny .
there is enormous scope for america’s global services companies to expand in china , especially in transactions-intensive distribution sectors – wholesale and retail trade , domestic transportation , and supply-chain logistics – as well as in the processing segments of finance , health care , and data warehousing .
the us needs to refocus the us-china trade agenda toward expanded market access in these and other areas – pushing back against chinese policies and government procurement practices that favor domestic production and indigenous innovation .
some progress has been made , but more is needed – for example , getting china to join the world trade organization’s government procurement agreement .
at the same time , the us should reconsider antiquated cold war restrictions on chinese purchases of technology-intensive items .
for a growth-starved us , the opportunities of market access far outweigh the currency threat .
the long-dormant chinese consumer is about to be unleashed .
this plays to one of america’s greatest strengths – its zeal to compete in new markets .
shame on the us if it squanders this extraordinary chance by digging in its heels at the upcoming strategic and economic dialogue .
america\u0027s retreat from asia
the united states' planned withdrawal of troops from asia , which president george w . bush announced on august 16 , need not harm peace and stability in the region and particularly in korea .
but a key condition for a smooth redeployment of us troops is close consultations by america with its allies , something it has not done well up to now .
south korea and japan need to have their views taken into serious account if this now inevitable withdrawal is to succeed .
by contrast , unilaterally announcing the withdrawal - and then unilaterally implementing it - may harm the very purpose that the remaining us troops in asia are intended to serve: assuring deterrence , stability , and nonproliferation in korea and asia .
the withdrawal plan is causing countless worries .
in japan , there are concerns that it will make the country america's frontline command post in asia , possibly beyond the scope of its bilateral security treaty with the us .
one result is that china feels nervous about the implications of any expansion of the american-japanese military partnership .
but the impact of america's planned troop withdrawals is felt most keenly in south korea .
in june , the bush administration revealed its plan to withdraw some 12 , 500 of the 37 , 000 us soldiers stationed in south korea by the end of 2005 . these include 3 , 600 troops from the 2nd brigade of the 2nd infantry division , who are already earmarked for redeployment in iraq .
the us defense department justifies this change as part of the so-called "global posture review" that it has been carrying out to provide more flexibility and mobility in deploying troops to more urgently needed places around the world .
but the unilateral nature of the announcement , and the abrupt timing of the plan , has incited alarm in south korea , and perhaps in japan , that withdrawal could pose serious risks to the vital role that us forces have performed in deterring another war in korea .
south koreans genuinely fear that the plan may weaken deterrence by sending north korea - which is demanding a us military withdrawal while refusing to abandon its nuclear weapons ambitions - the message that intransigence pays .
indeed , it should not be forgotten that north korea maintains an army of 1 . 1 million troops .
moreover , the manner in which the bush administration unveiled its withdrawal plan has weakened the credibility of the us-korean alliance .
america's unilateral announcement has fuelled rumors to the effect that withdrawal must have something to do with the rising tide of anti-americanism in south korea , and especially with the country's reluctance and delay in dispatching an additional 3 , 600 of its own soldiers to iraq .
the bush administration tries to rebut these charges by saying that the plan will not weaken the deterrence capabilities of american forces , for america's far more powerful air and naval presence in the area will be maintained .
moreover , the us plans to strengthen south korea's own forces by supplying some $11 billion worth of high-technology equipment over the next five years .
militarily , this argument does make sense .
politically and psychologically , however , the method , let alone the timing and implementation of the withdrawals , raises many questions about the ongoing viability of the us-korean security alliance , for the alliance now seems adrift , without a common purpose and with little direction from either side .
yet the bush administration insists: "the us views south korea as a strong and steadfast ally . we are committed to south korea's security and to our alliance and partnership with seoul . "
if washington is serious about these words , it should transform this commitment into a long-term and comprehensive alliance that can survive the current estrangement - and continue even after korean unification - by making a joint declaration with south korea's government at the highest level .
in order to allay misgivings and restore trust in the alliance , it is necessary for the us and south korea to reaffirm their common interests and values in pursuing deterrence , nonproliferation , stability , and democracy on the korean peninsula and across asia .
once they resolve to continue their alliance with these purposes in mind , it should be possible for responsible officials to work out guiding principles for concrete security cooperation .
specific negotiations on withdrawing american troops from korea or on redeploying them from the dmz to south of seoul must be carried out according to these principles .
in so doing , america must treat south korea as a full partner with its own voice in making decisions that affect its security interests .
as an american ally for 51 years , and as east asia's third-largest economy , south korea is entitled to be fully consulted on such decisions .
despite anti-american sentiments among some south koreans , a majority of the country's people wants american forces to remain as a stabilizing force .
securing a peaceful and nuclear-free korean peninsula , a place where the interests of china , japan , russia , and america directly intersect , is one of the most important security goals anywhere on the planet .
for this reason , america and south korea must restore a strategic vision for the future .
america\u0027s schizophrenic economy
the news about america's economy that dribbled out over the first half of march painted - once again - a picture that only a schizophrenic could create .
real investment ( investment adjusted for the declining prices of high-tech and information-related capital goods ) continued to roar ahead .
production and sales were consistent with the consensus forecast of real gdp growth at an annual rate of 4% or more .
yet , despite all this , employment remained stagnant: net job creation in the united states continues to stall .
this does not mean that employment in america cannot grow .
roughly 300 , 000 more americans are employed in education and health care than a year ago - an annual rate of employment growth of 1 . 7% .
a quarter of a million more americans are employed in business and professional services than a year ago - a 1 . 6% annual rate of employment growth .
the logic of stagnant employment is not that adding jobs to the american economy is impossible , but that demand growth is insufficient to create more jobs than are lost .
this is easy to demonstrate .
total nominal spending in america grows at 5 . 5% per year .
inflation is 1 . 5% per year .
and overall productivity growth is 3 . 5% per year .
so the equation is simple: 5 . 5%-1 . 5%-3 . 5% = 0 . 5% .
that 0 . 5% is all that is left for job growth , because that's all the job growth required to meet demand given the remarkably strong rate of growth of productivity .
where america's productivity growth is coming from is clear .
a relatively small part of it is coming from simple speed-up: in an economy where the amount of time it takes for the unemployed to find new jobs is close to a post-wwii record high , demands for speeding-up the pace of work will be met with a "yes , boss ! " rather than a "take this job and shove it ! "
a bigger part of this increased productivity comes from the extraordinary technological revolutions in computers and communications that have led to dramatic increases in the usefulness - and decreases in the cost - of high-tech capital .
the boost to wealth provided by the "new economy" is exceeding even its most avid boosters' wildest dreams .
what is unexpected is that the new wealth is flowing not to the shareholders of dot-com companies , but to purchasers and users of high-tech capital and the consumers they serve .
but why does this seem so surprising ?
at the end of the nineteenth century the huge amount of investment and technological progress in america's railroads appeared to benefit everyone but the stockholders and bondholders of railroad companies , as bust followed boom and ramming worthless securities down the throats of investors became wall street's favorite sport .
yet another part of us productivity growth due to the fact that high-tech capital gives america's firms enormous incentives to make massive but hard to see - and even harder to measure - investments in organization and business processes that are complementary to computerization and networking .
for the us to have a rate of productivity growth of 3 . 5% per annum rather than the pre-1995 rate of 1 . 2% is amazing .
that means an annual increment to world income of $250 billion from this source alone .
that's the equivalent of adding productive power equal to a quarter of the economy of india - and adding it every year .
this persistent acceleration in american productivity growth has , however , created a massive political problem for president george w . bush .
demand growth at a pace that in any previous decade would have been seen as highly satisfactory is suddenly desperately insufficient , and bush is being blamed ( with some justice ) for the slack labor market that has resulted .
but for everyone except bush - and those left unemployed by the lag in demand - it is an extraordinary opportunity .
the remarkable boosts to productivity that have been within america's grasp will ultimately lead to accelerating growth of real profits and real wages , if only us policy makers resist the temptation to pursue politically expedient , but economically damaging , measures to "protect" output and employment .
as the world's leading-edge economy , america faces the hardest work in ensuring growth , for it must create - not only copy and adapt - new technologies , better forms of capital , and more productive business organizations .
if america can grow as fast as it is now , that is very good news for other , less-developed economies , especially since one powerful effect of ongoing technological revolutions in computers and communications is to make it much easier to participate in the global division of labor now centered in the us .
so the schizophrenic american economy is a sign that the world is entering an economic era of truly wonderful things - if only we properly , and patiently , grasp them .
america’s scorched earth management
signs of the american economy’s perilous condition are everywhere – from yawning fiscal and current-account deficits to plummeting home prices and a feeble dollar .
but something that shows up in none of the economic indicators may be driving many of them: the deterioration of american management , which is undermining not only many of america’s great enterprises , but also its legendary spirit of enterprise .
paradoxically , one indicator that has been improving steadily in the us – productivity – may be the clearest sign of the problem .
when it comes to productivity , managers either invest in employee training , more efficient manufacturing processes , and the like , or they take steps that appear to boost productivity in the short run but that erode it in the long run .
productivity is a measure of output per hour worked .
so a company that fires all its workers and then ships from stock can look very productive – until it runs outs of stock .
of course , no company can do that , but many us companies have been shedding workers and middle managers in great numbers – the figures for january 2008 were up 19% from a year earlier .
meanwhile , those employees left behind must work that much harder , often without increased compensation .
workers’ wages , adjusted for inflation , fell in 2007 , continuing a trend throughout this decade .
that , too , is “ productive ” – until these overworked people quit or burn out .
a sustainable company is not a collection of “ human resources . ” it is a community of human beings .
its strength resides in its people , its culture , and the goodwill it has built up among its customers and suppliers .
so , as workers and middle managers have been departing these companies , they have taken with them not only much critical information , but often also the hearts and souls of their enterprises , with profound effects on american competitiveness .
consider high technology , where america is supposed to excel .
according to a november 2006 report by the task force on the future of american innovation , made up of prominent universities , think tanks , industry trade associations , and corporations , the high-tech trade deficit widened in 2005 , for the third consecutive year .
this is not clothing or cars , but america’s largest , and most renowned , export sector .
this deficit reflects an underlying research deficit .
of the 25 companies granted the most us patents in 2006 , only eight were american; 12 were japanese .
perhaps this helps to explain why , in a survey of more than 60 , 000 people in 29 countries conducted in 2007 by the new york-based reputation institute to rank the “ world’s most respected companies , ” the first us company on the list appeared in 15th place; the second was in 25th place .
no one can determine how much of america’s productivity gains in recent years have resulted from squeezing human capital , because such things are not measured .
but there has clearly been a great deal of reliance on this strategy , with companies shedding employees not only because they must , but often because they have not met wall street analysts’ financial expectations .
managers’ increased focus on maximizing shareholder value won many adherents when the idea was introduced in the 1980’s: the impersonal discipline of financial markets would force companies to become more productive and innovative .
and , in fact , much of the us productivity increase in the 1980’s and 1990’s can likely be attributed to large-scale investment in information and communications technology .
but , as the marginal productivity gains from such investment began to fall , senior managers’ survival and compensation continued to be tied to stock-market performance .
as a result , many simply learned to manage their companies’ short-term share price at the expense of attention to their products and customers .
moreover , because maximizing shareholder value is a poor incentive for workers and middle managers , companies’ boards have increasingly centralized power around chief executives , thereby encouraging a “ heroic ” form of leadership that is detached from the rest of the enterprise .
indeed , in many cases , the ceo – frequently a wall street-endorsed “ superstar ” parachuted in to “ shake things up ” – now
this shift to “ heroic ” leadership can be seen in ballooning ceo compensation .
according to a january 2008 report by the hay group , the ceo’s of the 50 largest us companies are now paid almost three times what their european counterparts receive ­– which is many hundreds of times more than their own workers .
until recently , the us asset-price bubble ­– first in the stock market , then in real estate – masked the underlying depreciation of american enterprises .
but the bubble itself resulted from the same management pathologies as those afflicting the real economy .
after all , managing for the short run encouraged mortgage lenders to offer artificially low “ teaser ” interest rates to lure potential homeowners .
and then those who bought these mortgages never bothered to investigate their underlying value – a spectacular abdication of managerial responsibility .
now that the bubble has burst , america’s current economic downturn is likely to be far worse than previous ones , because us enterprises will have to be rebuilt , slowly and carefully .
the dramatic weakening of the us dollar may help america to narrow its massive trade deficit , but we should not expect any sustained improvement without drastic changes in american management .
fortunately , it may be possible to minimize the fallout for the rest of the world .
while american economists , politicians , and business leaders have for years sought to sell their model of management abroad , many companies elsewhere have not been buying it .
as a result , other key economies remain healthier than america’s .
make no mistake: this problem was made in america , and that is where it will have to be solved .
america’s self-defeating hegemony
when i wrote about the “ end of history ” almost twenty years ago , one thing that i did not anticipate was the degree to which american behavior and misjudgments would make anti-americanism one of the chief fault-lines of global politics .
and yet , particularly since the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001 , that is precisely what has happened , owing to four key mistakes made by the bush administration .
first , the doctrine of “ preemption , ” which was devised in response to the 2001 attacks , was inappropriately broadened to include iraq and other so-called “ rogue states ” that threatened to develop weapons of mass destruction .
to be sure , preemption is fully justified vis-à-vis stateless terrorists wielding such weapons .
but it cannot be the core of a general non-proliferation policy , whereby the united states intervenes militarily everywhere to prevent the development of nuclear weapons .
the cost of executing such a policy simply would be too high ( several hundred billion dollars and tens of thousands of casualties in iraq and still counting ) .
this is why the bush administration has shied away from military confrontations with north korea and iran , despite its veneration of israel’s air strike on iraq’s osirak reactor in 1981 , which set back saddam hussein’s nuclear program by several years .
after all , the very success of that attack meant that such limited intervention could never be repeated , because would-be proliferators learned to bury , hide , or duplicate their nascent weapons programs .
the second important miscalculation concerned the likely global reaction to america’s exercise of its hegemonic power .
many people within the bush administration believed that even without approval by the un security council or nato , american power would be legitimized by its successful use .
this had been the pattern for many us initiatives during the cold war , and in the balkans during the 1990’s; back then , it was known as “ leadership ” rather than “ unilateralism . ”
but , by the time of the iraq war , conditions had changed: the us had grown so powerful relative to the rest of the world that the lack of reciprocity became an intense source of irritation even to america’s closest allies .
the structural anti-americanism arising from the global distribution of power was evident well before the iraq war , in the opposition to american-led globalization during the clinton years .
but it was exacerbated by the bush administration’s “ in-your-face ” disregard for a variety of international institutions as soon it came into office – a pattern that continued through the onset of the iraq war .
america’s third mistake was to overestimate how effective conventional military power would be in dealing with the weak states and networked transnational organizations that characterize international politics , at least in the broader middle east .
it is worth pondering why a country with more military power than any other in human history , and that spends as much on its military as virtually the rest of the world combined , cannot bring security to a small country of 24 million people after more than three years of occupation .
at least part of the problem is that it is dealing with complex social forces that are not organized into centralized hierarchies that can enforce rules , and thus be deterred , coerced , or otherwise manipulated through conventional power .
israel made a similar mistake in thinking that it could use its enormous margin of conventional military power to destroy hezbollah in last summer’s lebanon war .
both israel and the us are nostalgic for a twentieth-century world of nation-states , which is understandable , since that is the world to which the kind of conventional power they possess is best suited .
but nostalgia has led both states to misinterpret the challenges they now face , whether by linking al-qaeda to saddam hussein’s iraq , or hezbollah to iran and syria .
this linkage does exist in the case of hezbollah , but the networked actors have their own social roots and are not simply pawns used by regional powers .
this is why the exercise of conventional power has become frustrating .
finally , the bush administration’s use of power has lacked not only a compelling strategy or doctrine , but also simple competence .
in iraq alone , the administration misestimated the threat of wmd , failed to plan adequately for the occupation , and then proved unable to adjust quickly when things went wrong .
to this day , it has dropped the ball on very straightforward operational issues in iraq , such as funding democracy promotion efforts .
incompetence in implementation has strategic consequences .
many of the voices that called for , and then bungled , military intervention in iraq are now calling for war with iran .
why should the rest of the world think that conflict with a larger and more resolute enemy would be handled any more capably ?
but the fundamental problem remains the lopsided distribution of power in the international system .
any country in the same position as the us , even a democracy , would be tempted to exercise its hegemonic power with less and less restraint .
america’s founding fathers were motivated by a similar belief that unchecked power , even when democratically legitimated , could be dangerous , which is why they created a constitutional system of internally separated powers to limit the executive .
such a system does not exist on a global scale today , which may explain how america got into such trouble .
a smoother international distribution of power , even in a global system that is less than fully democratic , would pose fewer temptations to abandon the prudent exercise of power .
america’s self-inflicted decline
melbourne – if the broad post-world war ii prosperity that has endured for six decades comes to an end , both the united states and europe will be responsible .
with rare exceptions , politics has become a discredited profession throughout the west .
tomorrow is always treated as more important than next week , and next week prevails over next year , with no one seeking to secure the long-term future .
now the west is paying the price .
president barack obama’s instincts may be an exception here , but he is fighting powerful hidebound forces in the united states , as well as a demagogic populism , in the form of the tea party , that is far worse – and that might defeat him in 2012 , seriously damaging america in the process .
america’s friends around the world watched with dismay the recent brawl in over raising the federal government’s debt ceiling , and the us congress’s inability to come to anything like a balanced and forward-looking compromise .
on the contrary , the outcome represents a significant victory for the tea party’s minions , whose purpose seems to be to reduce government obligations and expenditures to a bare minimum ( some object even to having a central bank ) , and to maintain president george w . bush’s outrageous tax breaks for the wealthy .
america’s current fiscal problems are rooted in a long period of unfunded spending .
bush’s wars in afghanistan and iraq , and the manner in which he conducted the “ global war on terror ” made matters much worse , contributing to a totally unsustainable situation .
indeed , obama inherited an almost impossible legacy .
in the weeks since the debt ceiling agreement , it has become increasingly clear that good government might be impossible in the us .
the coming months of campaigning for the us presidency will be spent in petty brawling over what should be cut .
the example of recent weeks gives us no cause for optimism that us legislators will rise above partisan politics and ask themselves what is best for america .
in these circumstances , it is not surprising that financial markets have returned to extreme volatility .
the expenditure cuts mandated by the outcome of the debt-ceiling debate will reduce economic activity , thereby undermining growth and making debt reduction even more difficult .
providing further fiscal stimulus to boost economic growth would carry its own risks , owing to the debt ceiling and another , more ominous factor: america is already overly indebted , and there are signs that major holders of us government securities are finally tired of being repaid in depreciated currency .
most importantly , china’s call for the introduction of a new reserve currency stems from its frustration with the failure of major governments – whether in the us or europe – to govern their economic affairs with realism and good sense .
china recognizes that america is in great difficulty ( indeed , it recognizes this more clearly than the us itself ) , and that , given the poisonous political atmosphere prevailing in washington , there will be no easy return to good government , economic stability , and strong growth .
america’s leadership in world affairs began to weaken with the unilateralism of bush , and today’s economic problems are reinforcing this tendency .
to reverse america’s decline , obama needs bipartisan support for his ( quite mainstream ) policies , but so far the us congress has shown no stomach for a principled approach to its legislative duties .
if germany’s half-hearted efforts to stabilize europe somehow turn out to be successful , america’s position will be further eroded , and central banks around the world will begin to regard the euro once again as a reliable alternative to the dollar as a reserve currency .
the alternative , as china has suggested , would be to develop a new reserve currency .
these realities represent a power shift of a kind that we have not experienced in our lifetimes .
china’s economic power over the us is now substantial , and will limit not only america’s influence in the financial markets , but also its capacity to use military power .
if this forces america back towards what the international-relations scholar joseph nye calls “ soft power and multilateral diplomacy , ” it may well be a good thing .
but such approaches are anathema to the us republican party , and to its tea party faction in particular , and they might unnerve the many asians who are nervous at china’s growing military might .
the counter-argument – that any sell-off or failure by china to continue to buy us government securities would hurt china as much as america – is not valid .
as each year passes , china’s markets expand worldwide , and its domestic market comes to represent a greater percentage of its own gdp .
as a result , china will not need a strong dollar in the long term .
americans need to get their economic house in order before china loses its incentive to support the dollar .
on several occasions in the post-wwii period , the us has learned with great pain that there are limits to the effective use of military power .
american objectives could not be achieved in vietnam .
the outcome in iraq will not be determined until the last american troops have been withdrawn .
in afghanistan , where withdrawal dates have already been set , it is difficult to believe that a cohesive unified state can be established .
as the efficacy of military power is reduced , so the importance of economic power grows .
recognition of these central realities – and bipartisanship in addressing them – is critical for america’s future , and that of the west .
america’s socialism for the rich
with all the talk of “ green shoots ” of economic recovery , america’s banks are pushing back on efforts to regulate them .
while politicians talk about their commitment to regulatory reform to prevent a recurrence of the crisis , this is one area where the devil really is in the details – and the banks will muster what muscle they have left to ensure that they have ample room to continue as they have in the past .
the old system worked well for the bankers ( if not for their shareholders ) , so why should they embrace change ?
indeed , the efforts to rescue them devoted so little thought to the kind of post-crisis financial system we want that we will end up with a banking system that is less competitive , with the large banks that were too big too fail even larger .
it has long been recognized that those america’s banks that are too big to fail are also too big to be managed .
that is one reason that the performance of several of them has been so dismal .
because government provides deposit insurance , it plays a large role in restructuring ( unlike other sectors ) . &nbsp; normally , when a bank fails , the government engineers a financial restructuring; if it has to put in money , it , of course , gains a stake in the future .
officials know that if they wait too long , zombie or near zombie banks –&nbsp;with little or no net worth , but treated as if they were viable institutions – are likely to “ gamble on resurrection . ”
if they take big bets and win , they walk away with the proceeds; if they fail , the government picks up the tab .
this is not just theory; it is a lesson we learned , at great expense , during the savings &amp; loan crisis of the 1980’s .
when the atm machine says ,  “ insufficient funds , ” the government doesn’t want this to mean that the bank , rather than your account , is out of money , so it intervenes before the till is empty .
in a financial restructuring , shareholders typically get wiped out , and bondholders become the new shareholders .
sometimes , the government must provide additional funds; sometimes it looks for a new investor to take over the failed bank .
the obama administration has , however , introduced a new concept: too big to be financially restructured .
the administration argues that all hell would break loose if we tried to play by the usual rules with these big banks .
markets would panic .
so , not only can’t we touch the bondholders , we can’t even touch the shareholders – even if most of the shares’ existing value merely reflects a bet on a government bailout .
i think this judgment is wrong .
i think the obama administration has succumbed to political pressure and scare-mongering by the big banks .
as a result , the administration has confused bailing out the bankers and their shareholders with bailing out the banks .
restructuring gives banks a chance for a new start: new potential investors ( whether in equity or debt instruments ) will have more confidence , other banks will be more willing to lend to them , and they will be more willing to lend to others .
the bondholders will gain from an orderly restructuring , and if the value of the assets is truly greater than the market ( and outside analysts ) believe , they will eventually reap the gains .
but what is clear is that the obama strategy’s current and future costs are very high – and so far , it has not achieved its limited objective of restarting lending .
the taxpayer has had to pony up billions , and has provided billions more in guarantees – bills that are likely to come due in the future .
rewriting the rules of the market economy – in a way that has benefited those that have caused so much pain to the entire global economy – is worse than financially costly .
most americans view it as grossly unjust , especially after they saw the banks divert the billions intended to enable them to revive lending to payments of outsized bonuses and dividends .
tearing up the social contract is something that should not be done lightly .
but this new form of ersatz capitalism , in which losses are socialized and profits privatized , is doomed to failure .
incentives are distorted .
there is no market discipline .
the too-big-to-be-restructured banks know that they can gamble with impunity – and , with the federal reserve making funds available at near-zero interest rates , there are ample funds to do so .
some have called this new economic regime “ socialism with american characteristics . ”
but socialism is concerned about ordinary individuals .
by contrast , the united states has provided little help for the millions of americans who are losing their homes .
workers who lose their jobs receive only 39 weeks of limited unemployment benefits , and are then left on their own .
and , when they lose their jobs , most lose their health insurance , too .
america has expanded its corporate safety net in unprecedented ways , from commercial banks to investment banks , then to insurance , and now to automobiles , with no end in sight .
in truth , this is not socialism , but an extension of long standing corporate welfarism .
the rich and powerful turn to the government to help them whenever they can , while needy individuals get little social protection .
we need to break up the too-big-to-fail banks; there is no evidence that these behemoths deliver societal benefits that are commensurate with the costs they have imposed on others .
and , if we don’t break them up , then we have to severely limit what they do .
they can’t be allowed to do what they did in the past – gamble at others’ expenses .
this raises another problem with america’s too-big-to-fail , too-big-to-be-restructured banks: they are too politically powerful .
their lobbying efforts worked well , first to deregulate , and then to have taxpayers pay for the cleanup .
their hope is that it will work once again to keep them free to do as they please , regardless of the risks for taxpayers and the economy .
we cannot afford to let that happen .
america’s sputnik moment in beijing
new york – august 8 , 2008 , may someday be remembered as the first day of the post-american era .
or it could be remembered as another “ sputnik moment , ” when , as with the soviet foray into outer space in 1957 , the american people realized that the country had lost its footing and decided it was time for the united states to get its act together .
there was no mistaking the power and symbolism of the opening ceremonies for the beijing olympic games on august 8 .
that multimedia spectacular did far more than trace china’s 5 , 000-year history; it was a statement that china is a major civilization that demands and deserves its rightful place in the global hierarchy .
there was also no mistaking the symbolism of seeing president bush , waving cheerfully from his spot in the bleachers while chinese president hu jintao sat behind what looked more like a throne .
it is hard to imagine that china’s government , which obsesses over every minute issue of diplomatic protocol , had not orchestrated this stark image of america’s decline relative to the country to which it owes $1 . 4 trillion .
it would be hard to imagine franklin roosevelt or ronald reagan accepting a similar relative position .
at the very same time that bush was waving from the stands , russia was invading georgia , america’s closest partner in the caucasus .
russia’s message to other west-leaning countries in the former soviet world was clear: america cannot protect you .
frighteningly , the russians were likely correct .
while the iraq quagmire has made it difficult for america to project force around the world , america’s growing debt , conflicts with friends and enemies alike , absence of any perceivable strategy for changing times , and its political system’s seeming inability to take action to address these challenges have combined to turn america into a struggling giant .
today , from iran to darfur to zimbabwe to georgia , the world is witnessing the effects of a budding post-american world , and the picture does not look pretty .
as much as we all value the rise of new powers like china and india , it remains to be seen whether these countries will become as benevolent a power as america , however flawed , has been over the past half-century .
neo-colonialism is returning to africa , the global project of human rights is in retreat , and the world trade system is becoming far less open .
brutal dictators go unpunished because their interests are protected by large powers with stakes in their natural resources .
reversing this trend is not only in america’s interest , but also in the world’s interest .
to do so , americans must identify and address the great challenges the united states faces , starting from the ground up .
fixing america’s campaign finance structure , which leads to massive misallocations of government funds , resuscitating america’s wildly uneven and often moribund education system , building an immigration system that actively recruits the most talented people from around the world via a fast track to us citizenship , and developing a national energy policy that moves the us far more quickly toward energy independence would all be important steps in this direction .
working to rebuild the traditional bipartisan foreign-policy consensus would also make the us a far more predictable partner to friends and allies around the world .
and america must be a respectful partner in order to encourage rising powers like india and china to play more constructive roles in international affairs .
the world is not ready for the post-american era , and countries like china and india must play a far greater role in strengthening the existing institutions of world peace and , where appropriate , building new ones that can promote a positive agenda of security , dignity , rights , and prosperity across the globe .
the world community is not there yet , and until it is , the world needs a new kind of american leader – a leader able to inspire americans to fix their problems at home and work with partners across the globe in promoting a common agenda as bold and progressive as the order built from the ashes of world war ii 60 years ago .
the beijing olympics could be remembered as a new “ sputnik moment ” for the us , inspiring the country to meaningfully face the music of a changing world .
but america can make it so only by recognizing the great challenges it faces and taking bold steps towards addressing them , at home and with allies abroad .
america’s perilous pivot
madrid – the pacific or the middle east ?
for the united states , that is now the primary strategic question .
the violence in gaza , coming as president barack obama was meeting asia’s leaders in phnom penh , perfectly encapsulates america’s dilemma .
instead of being able to focus on us foreign policy’s “ pivot ” to asia , obama was forced to spend many hours in conversation with the leaders of egypt and israel , and to dispatch secretary of state hillary clinton from asia , in order to facilitate a cease-fire in gaza .
of the two geopolitical focal points demanding america’s attention , one represents the future and the other the past .
whereas asia played an important role in a us presidential election campaign that was marked by often-heated references to china’s rise , the middle east has kept the us bogged down for decades .
in addition to the eternal israel-palestine conflict , iraq’s instability , the arab spring , syria’s civil war , and the ongoing nuclear standoff with iran all demand america’s attention .
if the iran crisis were to boil over , the pivot to asia would no longer be america’s main foreign-policy priority .
but if the dispute with iran is resolved diplomatically , the middle east might , perhaps , be relegated to a position of lesser importance , as obama clearly desires .
the question , therefore , is whether the us will find itself drawn into another war in a region on which it depends less and less for energy .
indeed , the revolution in non-conventional hydrocarbons , particularly shale gas and oil , which the international energy agency recently predicted would make the us the world’s largest oil producer by 2020 , and the top energy producer overall by 2030 , will have enormous global repercussions .
for the us , energy self-sufficiency is the perfect excuse for a phased withdrawal from the middle east; freed from energy dependency , america should be able to concentrate on the pacific .
although maintaining stable global energy prices and its alliance with israel means that the us cannot cut itself off completely from the middle east’s troubles , the shift in focus to asia began early in obama’s first administration , with clinton announcing america’s strategic reorientation even before us troops began withdrawing from iraq .
following his re-election , obama’s first foreign visit was to myanmar , thailand , and cambodia – a choice that cannot have pleased china , as all three are asean members , while myanmar was , until it began its democratic transition , a close chinese ally .
asia is , of course , experiencing rapid economic growth , but managing the region’s strong nationalist tensions calls for the creation of regional security structures , together with closer economic integration .
complicating matters even more is what us scholar kenneth lieberthal and wang jisi , the dean of international studies at peking university , called in a recent paper for the brookings institution “ strategic distrust . ”
cultivating strategic trust between the twenty-first century’s leading powers will be fundamental to the international system’s harmonious functioning .
but how can this be achieved ?
as china will be importing three-quarters of its oil from the middle east by 2020 , one step forward would be china’s cooperation in finding solutions to the region’s problems .
after the january 2013 israeli elections , iran will again move to the top of obama’s foreign-policy agenda .
military intervention in iran – which itself will be holding a presidential election in june – would incite not only regional , but global , instability .
the arab world , russia , and china would be forced to take sides , straining global relations between the different poles of power and raising tensions in the pacific .
so china has a large strategic interest in working with the us to avoid a showdown .
beyond iran , the volatile situation throughout the middle east urgently demands solutions .
the latest eruption of violent conflict between hamas and israel underscores the importance of reviving the peace process .
syria’s civil war , in which a growing number of regional players have become involved , is beginning to look increasingly like a trial run for all-out war between sunni muslims ( saudi arabia and the other gulf states , turkey , and egypt ) and shia muslims ( iran and hezbollah ) for regional dominance .
iran’s leaders appear to believe that the us , having incurred extremely high economic and human costs from more than a decade of war , would rather avoid another military intervention .
us public opinion seems to confirm this .
a recent survey by the chicago council on global affairs indicated that 67% of americans believe that the iraq war was not worthwhile .
moreover , 69% do not believe that the us is safer from terrorism since the war in afghanistan , and 71% say that the experience in iraq shows that the us should take greater care in how it uses force .
but , if americans seem unlikely to be willing to invest billions of dollars in another dead-end foreign adventure , iran’s leaders , for their part , are increasingly hemmed in by international sanctions , which are beginning to wreak havoc on the country’s economy .
both sides may believe that their best option – at least for now – is to negotiate .
peaceful resolution of the iranian question would help the us to complete its shift toward asia .
china may not wish for that outcome , but its own vital interest in the security of middle east energy supplies should compel it to cooperate .
after all , another middle east conflict would poison and distort relations in the region for decades , which would be the worst of all possible consequences – for the us and china alike .
america’s suicidal statecraft
since its victory in the cold war , america’s global hegemony has rested on three pillars: economic power , military might , and a vast capacity to export its popular culture .
the recent emergence of additional powers – the european union , china , india , and a russia driven to recover its lost status – has eroded america’s capacity to shape events unilaterally .
even so , america remains by far the world’s most powerful country; its decline has more to do with its incompetent use of power than with the emergence of competitors .
it is american leaders’ “ suicidal statecraft , ” to use arnold toynbee’s pithy phrase for what he considered the ultimate cause of imperial collapse , that is to blame for america’s plight .
consider the middle east .
nothing reveals the decline of the united states in the region better than the contrast between america’s sober use of power in the first gulf war in 1991 and the hubris and deceit of today’s iraq war .
in 1991 , america forged the most formidable international coalition since world war ii , and led it in a fully legitimate war aimed at restoring regional balance after saddam hussein’s invasion of kuwait .
in 2003 , america went to war without its trans-atlantic allies after manipulating false assertions .
in doing so , the us embarked on a preposterous grand strategy that aimed no less at simultaneously dismantling iraq’s tyrannical regime , restructuring the entire middle east , destroying al-qaeda , and helping democracy to take root throughout the arab world .
the result has been utter failure: military defeat and a severe degradation of america’s moral standing .
rather than undermining radical islam , the us has legitimized it , in iraq and beyond .
indeed , what will now shape the future of the region is not democracy , but the violent divide between shiites and sunnis that the iraq war precipitated .
it is this muslim civil war that is allowing al-qaeda to gain a larger pool of recruits .
with iraq probably becoming the first arab country to be ruled by shiites , and hence integrated into an expanding shiite iranian empire , america’s sunni allies in the region now view the us as unreliable .
indeed , the us is seen as practically complicit in inciting a monumental reversal of islam’s fortunes , the shia revival .
nor is the gospel of democracy especially dear to america’s arab allies , for the call to democratize has only emboldened the islamists to challenge the incumbent elites for power .
admittedly , violent islamic fundamentalism has deeper roots in the fading promise of arab nationalism .
but america’s misbegotten democratic message has ended up alienating both its conservative regional allies , as it gave a new lease on life to political islam , which can use the ballot box as a route to power , and the islamists , whose electoral gains are then rejected by the us .
america’s biggest strategic blunder in the middle east arguably concerns the emergence of iranian power .
by destroying iraq as a counterbalancing regional force , the us dealt a major blow to its traditional gulf allies , for whom iraq served as a barrier against iran’s ambitions .
america offered iran on a silver platter strategic assets that khomeini’s revolution failed to acquire either in eight years of war against saddam or in its abortive attempts to export the islamic revolution throughout the region .
likewise , iran’s nuclear program gained momentum thanks to its sense of impunity following the colossal failure in iraq of america’s concept of “ preventive war . ”
the calamitous us military experience in iraq has left it strategically diminished .
iraq has now become god’s playground , and america can hope to achieve a modicum of stability there only with the help of other regional powers .
nevertheless , the us will remain the most influential external actor in the middle east , for its failure is one of leadership , not of actual power .
humbled by military defeat , america can recover its regional relevance only by avoiding the sin of hubris , and learning to lead without attempting to dominate .
this requires engaging revolutionary forces like iran and syria; respecting , rather than ostracizing , those islamist movements that have opted out from jihadism in favor of political participation; and leading an international alliance for an arab-israeli peace based on the arab league initiative .
indeed , the paradox of america’s pernicious policies in iraq is that they have created favorable conditions for an arab-israeli peace , as the emergence of iran and the threat of a fundamentalist tsunami have focused arab minds on the urgency of a settlement with israel .
the palestinian issue is not the source of all the middle east’s ills , but its resolution would dramatically improve america’s standing among arabs .
more importantly , it would deny iran the ability to link popular islamic and arab causes with its own hegemonic ambitions .
america’s threat to trans-pacific trade
mumbai – as if undermining the world trade organization’s doha round of global free-trade talks was not bad enough ( the last ministerial meeting in geneva produced barely a squeak ) , the united states has compounded its folly by actively promoting the trans-pacific partnership ( tpp ) .
president barack obama announced this with nine asian countries during his recent trip to the region .
the tpp is being sold in the us to a compliant media and unsuspecting public as evidence of american leadership on trade .
but the opposite is true , and it is important that those who care about the global trading system know what is happening .
one hopes that this knowledge will trigger what i call the “ dracula effect ” : expose that which would prefer to remain hidden to sunlight and it will shrivel up and die .
the tpp is a testament to the ability of us industrial lobbies , congress , and presidents to obfuscate public policy .
it is widely understood today that free-trade agreements ( ftas ) , whether bilateral or plurilateral ( among more than two countries but fewer than all ) are built on discrimination .
that is why economists typically call them preferential-trade agreements ( ptas ) .
and that is why the us government’s public-relations machine calls what is in fact a discriminatory plurilateral fta , a “ partnership ” invoking a false aura of cooperation and cosmopolitanism .
countries are , in principle , free to join the tpp .
japan and canada have said they plan to do so .
but a closer look reveals that china is not a part of this agenda .
the tpp is also a political response to china's new aggressiveness , built therefore in a spirit of confrontation and containment , not of cooperation .
the us has been establishing a template for its ptas that includes several items unrelated to trade . so it is no surprise that the tpp template includes numerous agendas unrelated to trade , such as labor standards and restraints on the use of capital-account controls , many of which preclude china’s accession .
from the outset , the tpp’s supposed openness has been wholly misleading .
towards this end , the tpp was negotiated with the weaker countries like vietnam , singapore , and new zealand , which were easily bamboozled into accepting such conditions .
only then were bigger countries like japan offered membership on a “ take it or leave it ” basis .
the pr machine then went into overdrive by calling the inclusion of these extraneous conditions as making the tpp a “ high-quality ” trade agreement for the twenty-first century , when in fact it was a rip-off by several domestic lobbies .
american regionalism closer to home shows the us now trying to promote the free trade agreement of the americas ( ftaa ) .
but its preferred template was to expand the north america free trade agreement ( canada , mexico , and the us ) to the andean countries and include huge doses of non-trade-related issues , which they swallowed .
this was not acceptable to brazil , the leading force behind the ftaa , which focuses exclusively on trade issues .
brazil’s former president luiz lula inácio da silva , one of the world’s great trade-union leaders , rejected the inclusion of labor standards in trade treaties and institutions .
the result of us efforts in south america , therefore , has been to fragment the region into two blocs , and the same is likely to happen in asia .
ever since the us realized that it had chosen the wrong region to be regional with , it has been trying to win a seat at the asian table .
the us finally got it with the tpp , simply because china had become aggressive in asserting its territorial claims in the south china sea , the south china sea , and vis-à-vis india and japan .
many asian countries joined the tpp to “ keep the us in the region ” in the face of chinese heavy-handedness .
they embraced the us in the same way that east europeans rushed to join nato and the european union in the face of the threat , real or imagined , posed by post-soviet russia .
america’s design for asian trade is inspired by the goal of containing china , and the tpp template effectively excludes it , owing to the non-trade-related conditions imposed by us lobbies .
the only way that a chinese merger with the tpp could gain credibility would be to make all non-trade-related provisions optional .
of course , the us lobbies would have none of it .
america’s three deficits
berkeley – this year began with a series of reports providing tantalizing evidence that economic recovery in the united states is strengthening .
the pace of job creation has increased , indicators for manufacturing and services have improved , and consumption spending has been stronger than anticipated .
but it is too early to celebrate .
output growth in the us remains anemic , and the economy continues to face three significant deficits: a jobs deficit , an investment deficit , and a long-run fiscal deficit , none of which is likely to be addressed in an election year .
although output is now higher than it was in the fourth quarter of 2007 , it remains far below what could be produced if labor and capacity were fully utilized .
that gap – between actual and potential output – is estimated at more than 7% of gdp ( more than $1 trillion ) .
the output gap reflects a deficit of more than 12 million jobs – the number of jobs needed to return to the economy’s peak 2007 employment level and absorb the 125 , 000 people who enter the labor force each month .
even if the economy grows at 2 . 5% in 2012 , as most forecasts anticipate , the jobs deficit will remain – and will not be closed until 2024 .
america’s jobs deficit is primarily the result of inadequate aggregate demand .
consumption , which accounts for about 70% of total spending , is constrained by high unemployment , weak wage gains , and a steep decline in home values and consumer wealth .
the uptick in consumption in the last months of 2011 was financed by a decline in the household saving rate and a large increase in consumer credit .
neither of these trends is healthy or sustainable .
with an unemployment rate of 8 . 5% , a labor-force participation rate of only 64% , and stagnant real wages , labor income has fallen to an historic low of 44% of national income .
and labor income is the most important component of household earnings , the major driver of consumption spending .
even before the great recession , american workers and households were in trouble .
the rate of job growth between 2000 and 2007 slowed to only half its level in the three preceding decades .
productivity growth was strong , but far outpaced wage growth , and workers’ real hourly compensation declined , on average , even for those with a university education .
indeed , the 2002-2007 period was the only recovery on record during which the median family’s real income declined .
moreover , job opportunities continued to polarize , with employment growing in high-wage professional , technical , and managerial occupations , as well as in low-wage food-service , personal-care , and protective-service occupations .
by contrast , employment in middle-skill , white-collar , and blue-collar occupations fell , particularly in manufacturing .
hard-pressed american households slashed their savings rates , borrowed against their home equity , and increased their debt to maintain consumption , contributing to the housing and credit bubbles that burst in 2008 , requiring painful deleveraging ever since .
three forces have driven the us labor market’s adverse structural changes:
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; skill-biased technological change , which has automated routine work while boosting demand for highly educated workers with at least a college degree .
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; global competition and the integration of labor markets through trade and outsourcing , which have eliminated jobs and depressed wages .
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; america’s declining competitiveness as an attractive place to locate production and employment .
technological change and globalization have created similar labor-market challenges in other developed countries .
but us policy choices are responsible for the erosion of america’s competitiveness .
in particular , the us is underinvesting in three major areas that help countries to create and retain high-wage jobs: skills and training , infrastructure , and research and development .
spending in these areas accounts for less than 10% of us government spending , and this share has been declining over time .
the federal government can currently borrow at record-low interest rates , and there are many projects in education , infrastructure , and research that would earn a higher return , create jobs now , and bolster us competitiveness in attracting high-wage jobs .
president barack obama has offered numerous proposals to invest in the foundations of national competitiveness , but congressional republicans have rebuffed them , claiming that the us faces an impending fiscal crisis .
in fact , the federal deficit as a share of gdp will shrink significantly over the next several years , even without further deficit-reduction measures , before rising to unsustainable levels by 2030 .
the us does indeed face a long-run fiscal deficit , largely the result of rising health-care costs and an aging population .
but the current fiscal deficit mainly reflects weak tax revenues , owing to slow growth and high unemployment , and temporary stimulus measures that are fading away at a time when aggregate demand remains weak and additional fiscal stimulus is warranted .
at the very least , to keep the economy on course for 2 . 5% growth this year , the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits proposed by obama should be extended through the end of the year .
these measures would provide insurance to the fragile recovery and add nothing to the long-run fiscal gap .
so , how should the us economy’s jobs deficit , investment deficit , and long-run fiscal deficit be addressed ?
policymakers should pair fiscal measures to ameliorate the jobs and investment deficits now with a multi-year plan to reduce the long-run fiscal deficit gradually .
this long-run plan should increase spending on education , infrastructure , and research , while curbing future growth in health-care spending through the cost-containment mechanisms contained in obama’s health-reform legislation .
approving a long-run deficit-reduction plan now but deferring its starting date until the economy is near full employment would prevent premature fiscal contraction from tipping the economy back into recession .
