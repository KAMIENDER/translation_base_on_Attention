indeed , enactment of such a package could bolster output and employment growth by easing investor concerns about future deficits and strengthening consumer and business confidence . <eos>
painful choices about how to close the long-run fiscal gap should be decided now and implemented promptly once the economy has recovered . <eos>
but , for the next few years , the priorities of fiscal policy should be jobs , investment , and growth . <eos>
america’s ungovernable budget <eos>
new york – the heart of any government is found in its budget . <eos>
politicians can make endless promises , but if the budget doesn’t add up , politics is little more than mere words . <eos>
the united states is now caught in such a bind . <eos>
in his recent state of the union address , president barack obama painted a convincing picture of modern , twenty-first-century government . <eos>
his republican party opponents complained that obama’s proposals would bust the budget . <eos>
but the truth is that both parties are hiding from the reality: without more taxes , a modern , competitive us economy is not possible . <eos>
obama rightly emphasized that competitiveness in the world today depends on an educated workforce and modern infrastructure . <eos>
that is true for any country , but it is especially relevant for rich countries . <eos>
the us and europe are in direct competition with brazil , china , india , and other emerging economies , where wage levels are sometimes one-quarter those in high-income countries ( if not even lower ) . <eos>
america and europe will keep their high living standards only by basing their competitiveness on advanced skills , cutting-edge technologies , and modern infrastructure . <eos>
that is why obama called for an increase in us public investment in three areas: education , science and technology , and infrastructure ( including broadband internet , fast rail , and clean energy ) . <eos>
he spelled out a vision of future growth in which public and private investment would be complementary , mutually supportive pillars . <eos>
obama emphasized these themes for good reason . <eos>
unemployment in the us now stands at nearly 10% of the labor force , in part because more new jobs are being created in the emerging economies , and many of the jobs now being created in the us pay less than in the past , owing to greater global competition . <eos>
unless the us steps up its investment in education , science , technology , and infrastructure , these adverse trends will continue . <eos>
but obama’s message lost touch with reality when he turned his attention to the budget deficit . <eos>
acknowledging that recent fiscal policies had put the us on an unsustainable trajectory of rising public debt , obama said that moving towards budget balance was now essential for fiscal stability . <eos>
so he called for a five-year freeze on what the us government calls “ discretionary ” civilian spending . <eos>
the problem is that more than half of such spending is on education , science and technology , and infrastructure – the areas that obama had just argued should be strengthened . <eos>
after telling americans how important government investment is for modern growth , he promised to freeze that spending for the next five years ! <eos>
politicians often change their message from one speech to the next , but rarely contradict it so glaringly in the same speech . <eos>
that contradiction highlights the sad and self-defeating nature of us budget policies over the past 25 years , and most likely in the years to come . <eos>
on the one hand , the us government must invest more to promote economic competitiveness . <eos>
on the other hand , us taxes are chronically too low to support the level of government investment that is needed . <eos>
america’s fiscal reality was made painfully clear two days after obama’s speech , in a new study from the congressional budget office , which revealed that the budget deficit this year will reach nearly $1 . 5 trillion – a sum almost unimaginable even for an economy the size of the us . <eos>
at nearly 10% of gdp , the deficit is resulting in a mountain of debt that threatens america’s future . <eos>
the cbo study also made clear that december’s tax-cut agreement between obama and the republican opposition willfully and deliberately increased the budget deficit sharply . <eos>
various tax cuts initiated by george w . bush were set to expire at the end of 2010 . <eos>
obama and the republicans agreed to continue those tax cuts for at least two years ( they will now probably continue beyond that ) , thereby lowering tax revenue by $350 billion this year and again in 2012 . <eos>
tax cuts for the richest americans were part of the package . <eos>
the truth of us politics today is simple . <eos>
the key policy for the leaders of both political parties is tax cuts , especially for the rich . <eos>
both political parties , and the white house , would rather cut taxes than spend more on education , science and technology , and infrastructure . <eos>
and the explanation is straightforward: the richest households fund political campaigns . <eos>
both parties therefore cater to their wishes . <eos>
as a result , america’s total tax revenues as a share of national income are among the lowest of all high-income countries , roughly 30% , compared to around 40% in europe .  but 30% of gdp is not enough to cover the needs of health , education , science and technology , social security , infrastructure , and other vital government responsibilities . <eos>
one budget area can and should be cut: military spending . <eos>
but even if america’s wildly excessive military budget is cut sharply ( and politicians in both parties are resisting that ) , there will still be a need for new taxes . <eos>
the economic and social consequences of a generation of tax cutting are clear . <eos>
america is losing its international competitiveness , neglecting its poor – one in five american children is trapped in poverty – and leaving a mountain of debt to its young . <eos>
for all of the obama administration’s lofty rhetoric , his fiscal-policy proposals make no serious attempt to address these problems . <eos>
to do so would require calling for higher taxes , and that – as george h . w . bush learned in 1992 – is no way to get re-elected . <eos>
america’s unhinged “ pivot ” <eos>
new delhi – president barack obama’s first foreign trip since winning a second term highlights asia’s new centrality to america’s economy and security . <eos>
but obama’s asian tour also underscores the main question about american policy in the region: will the united states’ “ pivot ” to asia acquire concrete strategic content , or will it remain largely a rhetorical repackaging of old policies ? <eos>
the united states , quick to capitalize on regional concerns triggered by china’s increasingly muscular self-assertion , has strengthened its military ties with its existing asian allies and forged security relationships with new friends . <eos>
but the heady glow of america’s return to center stage in asia has obscured key challenges in remaining the region’s principal security anchor in the face of china’s strategic ambitions . <eos>
one challenge is the need to arrest the erosion of america’s relative power , which in turn requires comprehensive domestic renewal , including fiscal consolidation . <eos>
but the need for spending cuts also raises the prospect that the us might be unable to finance a military shift toward the asia-pacific region – or , worse , that it will be forced to retrench there . <eos>
the us under obama has increasingly ceded ground to china , a trend that admittedly began when the bush administration became preoccupied with the wars in afghanistan and iraq . <eos>
this has spurred doubts about america’s ability to provide strategic heft to its “ pivot ” by sustaining a higher level of commitment in the asia-pacific region , where it already maintains 320 , 000 troops . <eos>
the proposed deployment of an additional 2 , 500 marines in australia is largely symbolic . <eos>
in fact , after raising asians’ expectations of a more robust us response to china’s growing assertiveness , the obama administration has started to tamp down the military aspects of its “ pivot , ” emphasizing instead greater us economic engagement . <eos>
that change has come as a relief to those in the region who fear being forced to choose between the us and china . <eos>
but , for the countries bearing the brunt of china’s recalcitrant approach to territorial and maritime disputes , this emphasis raises new doubts about america’s commitment . <eos>
in fact , the economic reorientation of the us “ pivot ” corrects a policy that had overemphasized the military component and put the us on a path toward conflict with china . <eos>
it was secretary of state hillary clinton who signaled a more hawkish us stance on china with her tough talk at the 2010 association of southeast asian nations ( asean ) regional forum in hanoi; now she is moderating that position by promoting trade and investment during her visits to asian countries . <eos>
obama , too , is highlighting the economic aspects of the us “ pivot , ” portraying his asia tour as an effort to generate more domestic manufacturing jobs through higher exports to “ the most rapidly growing and dynamic region in the world . ” <eos>
even his historic visit to myanmar – the first ever by a us president – is as much about trade as it is about weaning a strategically located , resource-rich country from chinese influence . <eos>
the refocus on trade and economic issues has also prompted washington to promote the trans-pacific partnership , which aims to create a new asia-pacific free-trade group that excludes china . <eos>
moreover , the us is emphasizing the importance of the east asia summit and asean , whose summit overlaps with the eas meeting in phnom penh that obama will be attending . <eos>
the us course correction is being dictated by another consideration as well: america has nothing to gain from taking sides in china’s disputes with its neighbors – unless , of course , us interests are directly at stake , as in the south china sea , where chinese maritime claims threaten freedom of navigation in some of the world’s most heavily trafficked shipping lanes . <eos>
concern for its own national interest explains why america has charted a course of tacit neutrality regarding the revival of sino-indian territorial disputes , including china’s sudden resurrection of a claim to the large himalayan indian state of arunachal pradesh . <eos>
similarly , the us has urged both china and japan to resolve peacefully their dispute over the japanese-controlled senkaku islands . <eos>
america’s main goal is to prevent the standoff from escalating to the point that it would be forced – against its own interests –&#160;to take japan’s side . <eos>
when us defense secretary leon panetta met chinese leader xi jinping in china in september , he got “ an earful ” that the us should stay out of the sino-japanese dispute . indeed , amid the orchestrated anti-japanese protests in china in september , panetta – instead of advising china to rein in the often-violent demonstrations –&#160;publicly reiterated america’s neutrality in the struggle over control of the islands . <eos>
the correction in us policy actually extends even to terminology . <eos>
american diplomats have now abandoned the term “ pivot ” altogether , owing to its military connotation , in favor of “ rebalancing . ” <eos>
whatever one calls it , the new policy approach is all about china , with america bolstering alliances and friendships with countries around china’s periphery , including india , japan , the philippines , vietnam , indonesia , and south korea . <eos>
yet the obama administration continues to deny that china is at the center of its strategy . in fact , it is reluctant to say or do anything publicly that might raise china’s hackles . <eos>
the asia-pacific region will loom larger in obama’s second-term agenda , especially as the ongoing us troop withdrawal ends the afghanistan war by 2014 . <eos>
but obama will have to define a clearer us policy , addressing china’s rapid rise under an authoritarian regime that aggressively pursues border claims and whips up nationalism at home . <eos>
the us and the rest of asia must not merely adjust to china; they must seek to shape a china that plays by the rules . <eos>
america’s war-torn economy <eos>
new york – some say there are two issues in the coming american elections: the iraq war and the economy . <eos>
on days when the war seems to be going better than expected , and the economy worse , the economy eclipses the war; but neither is faring well . <eos>
in some sense , there is only one issue , and that is the war , which has exacerbated america’s economic problems . <eos>
and when the world’s largest economy is sick – and it is now very sick – the entire world suffers . <eos>
it used to be thought that wars were good for the economy . <eos>
after all , world war ii is widely thought to have helped lift the global economy out of the great depression . <eos>
but , at least since keynes , we know how to stimulate the economy more effectively , and in ways that increase long-term productivity and enhance living standards . <eos>
this war , in particular , has not been good for the economy , for three reasons . <eos>
first , it has contributed to rising oil prices . <eos>
when the united states went to war , oil cost less than $25 a barrel , and futures markets expected it to remain there for a decade . <eos>
futures traders knew about the growth of china and other emerging markets; but they expected supply – mainly from low-cost middle east providers – to increase in tandem with demand . <eos>
the war changed that equation . <eos>
higher oil prices mean that americans ( and europeans and japanese ) are paying hundreds of millions of dollars to middle east oil dictators and oil exporters elsewhere in the world rather than spending it at home . <eos>
moreover , money spent on the iraq war does not stimulate the economy today as much as money spent at home on roads , hospitals , or schools , and it doesn’t contribute as much to long-term growth . <eos>
economists talk about “ bang for the buck ” – how much economic stimulus is provided by each dollar of spending . <eos>
it’s hard to imagine less bang than from bucks spent on a nepalese contractor working in iraq . <eos>
with so many dollars going abroad , the american economy should have been in a much weaker shape than it appeared . <eos>
but , much as the bush administration tried to hide the true costs of the war by incomplete and misleading accounting , the economy’s flaws were covered up by a flood of liquidity from the federal reserve and by lax financial regulation . <eos>
so much money was pumped into the economy and so lax were regulators that one leading american bank advertised its loans with the slogan “ qualified at birth ” – a clear indication that there were , in effect , no credit standards . <eos>
in a sense , the strategy worked: a housing bubble fed a consumption boom , as savings rates plummeted to zero .   the economic weaknesses were simply being postponed to some future date; the bush administration hoped that the day of reckoning would come after november 2008 .   instead , things began to unravel in august 2007 . <eos>
now it has responded , with a stimulus package that is too little , too late , and badly designed . <eos>
to see the inadequacy of that package , compare it with the more than $1 . 5 trillion that was borrowed in home equity loans in recent years , most of it spent on consumption . <eos>
that game – based on a belief in ever-spiraling home prices – is over . <eos>
with home prices falling ( and set to continue to fall ) , and with banks uncertain of their financial position , lenders will not lend and households will not borrow . <eos>
so , while the additional liquidity injected into the financial system by the fed may have prevented a meltdown , it won’t stimulate much consumption or investment . <eos>
instead , much of it will find its way abroad . <eos>
china , for example , is worried that the fed’s stimulus will increase its domestic inflation . <eos>
there is a third reason that this war is economically bad for america . <eos>
not only has america already spent a great deal on this war – $12 billion a month , and counting – but much of the bill remains to be paid , such as compensation and health care for the 40% of veterans who are returning with disabilities , many of which are very serious . <eos>
moreover , this war has been funded differently from any other war in america’s history –perhaps in any country’s recent history . <eos>
normally , countries ask for shared sacrifice , as they ask their young men and women to risk their lives . <eos>
taxes are raised . <eos>
there is a discussion of how much of the burden to pass on to future generations .   in this war , there was no such discussion . <eos>
when america went to war , there was a deficit . <eos>
yet remarkably , bush asked for , and got , a reckless tax cut for the rich . <eos>
that means that every dollar of war spending has in effect been borrowed . <eos>
for the first time since the revolutionary war , two centuries ago , america has had to turn to foreigners for financing , because us households have been saving nothing . <eos>
the numbers are hard to believe . <eos>
the national debt has increased by 50% in eight years , with almost $1 trillion of this increase due to the war – an amount likely to more than double within ten years . <eos>
who would have believed that one administration could do so much damage so quickly ? <eos>
america , and the world , will be paying to repair it for decades to come . <eos>
obama’s year of iran <eos>
princeton – as us president barack obama begins his second term , he will have to devote much of his attention to figuring out how to get america’s domestic finances in order . <eos>
but foreign-policy issues loom large as well , and , notwithstanding the ongoing conflict in syria and the possible spread of war across africa’s sahel region , the consensus in washington is that 2013 will be the “ year of decision ” on iran . <eos>
obama began his first administration with an offer to engage with the islamic republic; as he memorably put it in his first inaugural address in 2009 , “ we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist . ” <eos>
he repeated that commitment , although much more obliquely , in his second inaugural address: “ we will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully – not because we are naive about the dangers we face , but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear . ” <eos>
as the american scholar and activist hussein ibish recently argued , obama has appointed a cabinet designed to give him maximum room to negotiate a deal with iran . <eos>
in particular , naming military veterans as secretary of state and secretary of defense will provide him with valuable domestic political cover for an agreement that would inevitably require lifting sanctions on iran and almost certainly recognizing its right to enrich uranium at a low level of concentration . <eos>
that should signal to iran’s rulers not only that the us is serious about a deal , but also that whatever the us offers is likely to be the best deal that they can get . <eos>
the obama administration has assembled an extraordinary coalition of countries to impose economic sanctions that are having a demonstrable effect on the price and availability of goods in iran and on the ability of even powerful institutions , such as the revolutionary guard , to do business . <eos>
but coalitions do not hold together forever , and the pain of sanctions often cuts both ways , affecting buyers as well as sellers . <eos>
countries like south korea and japan , for example , have curtailed their imports of iranian oil only reluctantly; countries like china and russia rarely play straight on sanctions in the first place . <eos>
moreover , obama can threaten that “ all options are on the table ” only so many times without losing credibility with the iranians and other countries in the middle east . <eos>
as brookings institution foreign-policy expert suzanne maloney points out , countries in the region and beyond are already dismayed at the lack of us leadership concerning syria . <eos>
if the us gives negotiations one more serious try ( a credible offer and a genuine willingness to engage ) , gets rebuffed , and then does nothing , it will effectively declare itself a paper tiger . <eos>
at that point , the sanctions coalition will most likely disintegrate amid a much broader loss of confidence in us leadership . <eos>
the us has thus painted itself into a corner . <eos>
former us national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski recently argued strongly against military action , proposing , instead , a strategy that would continue sanctions and extend deterrence . <eos>
like us policy toward the soviet bloc during the cold war , “ an iranian military threat aimed at israel or any other us friend in the middle east would be treated as if directed at the united states itself and would precipitate a commensurate us response . ” <eos>
i can certainly see the wisdom in brzezinski’s approach . <eos>
but obama has marched the us and its allies too far down the current path . <eos>
moreover , and crucially , brzezinski forgets that obama’s determination to stop iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon does not stem only from his concern for israel’s security or the stability of the wider middle east . <eos>
obama has repeatedly committed himself to the goal of turning the world in the direction of “ global zero ” – a world without nuclear weapons . <eos>
he believes ( as do former secretaries of state henry kissinger and george shultz , former secretary of defense william perry , and former senator sam nunn ) that unless the world finds a way to live without nuclear weapons , we will find ourselves in an international system in which 30-50 states possess them , raising the danger of accidental or deliberate launch to an unacceptably high level . <eos>
convincing great powers to eliminate their nuclear arsenals might seem as politically fanciful as pushing gun-control legislation through the us congress , but on that issue , too , obama has made clear that he is willing to try . <eos>
however logical or attractive a containment policy might be , and however disastrous the consequences of bombing are likely to be , obama’s commitment to realizing global denuclearization as part of his legacy implies that he will not allow another country to acquire a nuclear weapon on his watch , as his predecessors allowed india , israel , north korea , and pakistan to do . <eos>
thus , the stakes for both the us and iran are very high . <eos>
other countries would do well not to underestimate obama’s resolve; governments that have relations with iran should emphasize that the time to make a deal is now . <eos>
and countries like turkey and brazil ( and perhaps india and egypt ) could play a useful role by devising face-saving ways for the iranians to meet the international community’s demands , together with longer-term alternatives for fuel enrichment that would be consistent with reducing the global nuclear threat . <eos>
america’s allies , in turn , must be prepared to close ranks with it on both the outlines of a deal and the willingness to strike militarily . <eos>
the art of statecraft is not to choose between war and diplomacy as if they were mutually exclusive alternatives , but to understand how they fit together . <eos>
in the case of syria , the west has repeatedly called for diplomacy while ruling out any military action , with predictably bad results . <eos>
the us will not make that mistake with iran . <eos>
america the hypocritical <eos>
in commemorating the 230th anniversary of america’s independence last july , president george w . bush noted that the patriots of the revolutionary war believed that all men are created equal , and with inalienable rights . <eos>
because of these ideals , he proclaimed , the united states “ remains a beacon of hope for all who dream of liberty and a shining example to the world of what a free people can achieve . ” <eos>
but , at the same time , his administration was holding approximately 400 prisoners at the us naval base at guantánamo bay in cuba . <eos>
some of them have now been there for more than five years . none of them has ever been put on trial . <eos>
last month , a highly reputable source confirmed that the guantánamo prisoners are suffering from more than indefinite detention . <eos>
the us federal bureau of investigation released documents showing that an fbi agent witnessed “ on several occasions ” detainees who were “ chained hand and foot in [ a ] fetal position to [ the ] floor , ” without a chair , or food or water . <eos>
in these conditions , “ most urinated or defecated on [ them ] selves . ” <eos>
they were left there for 18 or 24 hours , or more . <eos>
on one of these occasions , the agent reported , “ the air conditioning was turned up so low that the barefooted detainee was shaking with cold . ” <eos>
on another occasion the room was unventilated , the temperature over 100 degrees fahrenheit , and the detainee was almost unconscious on the floor with a pile of hair next to him – “ he had apparently been pulling it out throughout the night . ” <eos>
another fbi agent was laughingly told by a civilian contractor , “ [ y ] ou have to see this . ” <eos>
he was then taken to an interrogation room where he saw a longhaired man with a full beard who was gagged with duct tape that “ covered much of his head . ” <eos>
when the agent asked how the tape would be removed , he was not given any answer . <eos>
other fbi agents reported seeing prisoners left in shackles for 12 hours or more , again in cold conditions , being subjected to strobe lights and loud rap music for many hours , or being forced to wrap themselves in an israeli flag . <eos>
the fbi report noted these incidents with the comment: “ doesn’t seem excessive given department of defense policy . ” <eos>
several of the detainees told the fbi agents that they had no connection with terrorism and had no idea why they had been abducted and taken to guantánamo . <eos>
many prisoners were not captured fighting in afghanistan . <eos>
some were picked up in bosnia , indonesia , thailand , mauritania , and pakistan . <eos>
the bush administration says that the detainees are “ enemy combatants ” in the global war against terror – a war that is being waged around the world , and that could last for decades . <eos>
the commander of the guantánamo task force , rear admiral harry b . harris , jr . , recently defended harsh treatment of his prisoners , claiming , “ they’re all terrorists; they’re all enemy combatants . ” <eos>
but the cia has made mistakes before . <eos>
for example , murat kurnaz , a german-born turkish man , was held in guantánamo for four years before being released last august . <eos>
the case of khaled el-masri , a german citizen of lebanese descent , appears to be another of these errors . <eos>
seized by the cia in macedonia , he was taken to afghanistan and interrogated for five months before being released without charge . <eos>
a german court has now issued arrest warrants for those involved in his abduction . <eos>
if there are any human rights at all , the right not to be locked up indefinitely without trial is surely one of them . <eos>
the us constitution’s bill of rights puts considerable emphasis on that right , specifying in the sixth amendment that in all criminal prosecutions , “ the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial , by an impartial jury ” and “ to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him . ” <eos>
none of the guantánamo inmates has been granted these rights . <eos>
so it has never been proved , by the standards laid down in the us constitution that any of them really are terrorists . <eos>
but the sixth amendment does not apply to the guantánamo prisoners , because they are not us citizens and are in a facility that , technically , is not part of us territory , although it is under the full control of the us government . <eos>
whatever us courts say about it , abducting people all over the world , locking them up for years without establishing that they are guilty of anything , and subjecting them to harsh and abusive treatment is a flagrant violation of international law . <eos>
by any standard of justice , it is also just plain wrong . <eos>
tom paine , the great american revolutionary and author of the rights of man , wrote: “ he that would make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from oppression; for if he violates this duty he establishes a precedent that will reach himself . ” <eos>
if america would only follow that advice , it might really be a beacon of hope and a shining example . <eos>
but as long as it continues to hold and abuse prisoners without giving them a fair trial , america’s professed ideals will continue to sound to the rest of the world like the deepest hypocrisy . <eos>
the state of the united states <eos>
new york – the us presidential election is still more than half a year away , and it is impossible to know with any certainty who will be nominated to represent the major parties , much less who will be the 45th occupant of the white house . <eos>
but it is not too soon to assess the mood of the country's more than 320 million inhabitants and what it will mean for the man or woman who ultimately prevails in what must seem to most people around the world to be an endless political soap opera . <eos>
the dominant mood in the united states today is one of considerable anxiety , if not outright anger . <eos>
the washington post recently published a four-part series of articles revealing popular fury aimed at wall street , muslims , trade deals , washington , police shootings , president barack obama , republicans , immigrants , and other targets . <eos>
one of the worst descriptions to be applied to a person nowadays is “ professional politician . ” <eos>
the beneficiaries of this state of mind are anti-establishment candidates who espouse policies in opposition to free trade and immigration reform and who call for a radical overhaul of current tax and spending policies . <eos>
the details of what they advocate may well differ , but their platforms share a promise of radical departure from the status quo . <eos>
the basis of this mood is hardly self-evident , as the country is better off economically than it was a half-dozen years ago , in the immediate aftermath of the 2007-2008 economic crisis . <eos>
over nine million jobs have been created since then , interest rates are low ( making loans for homes and cars more affordable ) , and the fall in the price of gasoline is the equivalent of a $700 tax cut for the average american family . <eos>
moreover , the stock market has risen some 200% since its low of seven years ago , and millions of people who were without health insurance are now covered . <eos>
yet this good economic news is offset in many cases by weak growth in household incomes , which have stagnated in real ( inflation-adjusted ) terms for some 15 years . <eos>
the percentage of americans working full time has still not reached the level it was at seven years ago . <eos>
and many fear that their jobs will disappear because of foreign competition , new technologies , or outsourcing . <eos>
a large number of americans are living longer , but are anxious , as they have failed to set aside the funds needed to ensure that their retirement will allow them to live comfortably into old age . <eos>
some are paying health-insurance premiums that they previously had avoided because of mandates in the reform enacted under obama . <eos>
there is also the issue of inequality . <eos>
this causes real anger , but the problem is not so much inequality ( which , though worse , is nothing inherently new ) as it is the decline in opportunity . <eos>
the american dream is giving way to class consciousness – a profound change for a country founded on the ideal that anyone can improve his or her lot through hard work . <eos>
but the reasons for anxiety and anger transcend economic realities and worries . <eos>
there is also physical insecurity , whether because of crime or the fear of terrorism . <eos>
in many communities , there is concern , too , about where the culture and the society are heading . <eos>
modern media tend to make things worse . <eos>
ours is an age of “ narrowcasting , ” not broadcasting . <eos>
people increasingly tune in to cable channels or websites that reinforce their views and ideologies . <eos>
little of this is reassuring . <eos>
the national mood transcends the election campaign and will pose a real challenge to the new president and congress . <eos>
the divisions within and between the democratic and republican parties will make compromise and the formation of coalitions that are essential for governing all but impossible . <eos>
concerns over retirement and health-care affordability will make it that much more difficult to reform entitlements , even though their expansion will drive up the national debt to record levels . <eos>
free trade is blamed for job losses and is losing support , even though it has also been a source of new jobs and greater consumer choice – and has strengthened america’s strategic position around the world . <eos>
immigration , long part of the country’s heritage and a source of valuable talent , is now the object of so much controversy that prospects for reform are dim . <eos>
the mood of the us may also intensify officials’ domestic focus . <eos>
already turned off by foreign involvement in the wake of the iraq and afghanistan interventions , which cost much more than they achieved , many americans are skeptical of what the us can accomplish abroad . <eos>
they are frustrated with allies seen as not carrying their fair share of common burdens , and they are increasingly convinced that the government needs to focus less on the world and more on fixing what is wrong with the us . <eos>
some in other countries will no doubt read all of this with satisfaction; but , overall , it is bad news for much of the world . <eos>
an america that is distracted and divided is less likely to be willing and able to take the lead in promoting stability in the middle east , europe , or asia , or in meeting global challenges . <eos>
and , without us leadership , these challenges are likely to go unmet , turning into problems or , worse , crises . <eos>
america wakes up to climate change <eos>
after years of debate in the united states , and opposition to action by the bush administration , america is finally waking up to the reality of global climate change . <eos>
leadership is still not coming from the president , but the private sector has begun to act . <eos>
leaders of major us companies have decided that global man-made climate change is real , must be controlled , and that business must play a constructive part in the process . <eos>
thus , even as the bush administration and some scientific contrarians pretend that there is no problem , us corporate leaders are seeking practical solutions . <eos>
the basic situation has been clear for years . <eos>
global use of fossil fuels is contributing to a sharp rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide , which is causing the earth to warm . <eos>
rainfall patterns are changing . <eos>
deserts and dry regions are becoming drier . <eos>
extreme weather events such as hurricanes and typhoons are likely to increase . <eos>
flooding in europe is likely to intensify , a process that may already have begun . <eos>
sea levels are rising , and could climb sharply if global warming leads to a destabilization of the greenland and antarctic ice sheets . <eos>
in short , the scientific evidence is strong and growing that the planet is at grave risk , with many ill effects already being felt and more to come . <eos>
the proper responses are also increasingly understood . <eos>
we must move to a sustainable energy system , one that does not mean a huge increase of carbon in the atmosphere . <eos>
this will require a shift to renewable energy sources such as solar power , and perhaps nuclear power , as well as new technologies to capture carbon dioxide at power plants and then to dispose of the carbon dioxide in safe underground deposits . <eos>
society will have to pay a price for these investments in new energy technologies , but the benefits will be vastly greater than the price . <eos>
the us is the world’s major emitter of carbon dioxide from energy use , but it has done the least among all major economies to confront the global challenge . <eos>
the bush administration claims that more research is needed before any action is taken . <eos>
yet real action in the us is starting , thanks to leadership in other parts of the world , and thanks to the enlightened understanding of some major american businesses . <eos>
first , the rest of the world ratified the kyoto protocol to control emissions of carbon dioxide . <eos>
at the beginning of this year , europe introduced a new greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme that uses market-based incentives to control carbon emissions . <eos>
american companies operating in europe are part of that system for their european-based emissions , so that us companies are being pulled into climate control even if their own government avoids the issue . <eos>
second , major us investors , such as pension fund managers , are realizing that us companies that fail to control their emissions may be vulnerable to financial losses in the future . <eos>
they know that , sooner or later , the us will have to join the rest of the world in controlling climate change . <eos>
at that point , power companies that use antiquated technologies that emit massive amounts of greenhouse gases may face serious financial losses . <eos>
so investors are telling companies to report their carbon emissions today in order to assess future liabilities . <eos>
similarly , many company bosses know that pretending that climate problems do not exist is bad for shareholders , because reality will one day strike . <eos>
they know that investing today in clean technologies can give them a long-term competitive advantage . <eos>
as a result , many companies are taking steps now to limit their emissions to avoid future financial liabilities and a lack of investor confidence . <eos>
the most dramatic breakthrough of this kind occurred when general electric , one of the world’s most important , innovative , and respected companies , announced that it was going “ green ” with a major new corporate focus on environmentally sound technologies and a commitment to limit its own greenhouse gas emissions . <eos>
with ge’s leadership , which it termed “ ecomagination ” ( combining ecology with imagination ) , many us businesses are sure to follow . <eos>
it is too early to count on success in engaging the us on climate change . <eos>
the bush administration continues to delay and to avoid sound science . <eos>
yet it is reasonably clear that a tipping point has been reached . <eos>
reality is catching up with the us , as it already has elsewhere in the world . <eos>
as us citizens and businesses continue to suffer the results of climate change – heat waves , droughts , hurricanes , and floods – more and more americans , including an increasing number of business leaders , will press america’s political leaders for real action . <eos>
the solutions will not be easy , and the effort must last over many decades in all parts of the world . <eos>
but the effort needs to start now . <eos>
as with europe’s new carbon trading , all producers and consumers around the globe will need to face market incentives to adopt technologies and consumption patterns that slow ( and eventually stop ) the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere . <eos>
we will all need to pay a “ market price ” when we contribute to global climate change , so that we give true economic incentives to sustainable energy systems and new public investments – for example , mass transit – that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and thereby head off future climatic disasters . <eos>
the right weights for mortgage risks <eos>
abu dhabi – ever since hunter-gatherers started to build their own dwellings some 14 , 000 years ago , homeownership has been a mark of high social and economic status . <eos>
today , the united states has built a mammoth financial bureaucracy to promote homeownership , and economists , bankers , politicians , and of course homeowners themselves keenly follow house-price indicators . <eos>
but , as we have recently witnessed , unless mortgage risks are properly calculated , the dream of homeownership can all too easily become an economic nightmare . <eos>
mortgage debt has become households’ biggest liability throughout the developed world . <eos>
in the decade preceding the financial crisis , us mortgage debt increased almost threefold , while the real economy grew by only one-third . <eos>
at its 2007 peak , us mortgage debt stood at $10 . 6 trillion – more than double the combined gdp of china and india . <eos>
the six major banking crises in the advanced economies since the mid-1970s were all associated with a housing bust . <eos>
a real-estate price crash has also been a key cause of emerging-market crises , such as the 1997-98 asian collapse . <eos>
research shows that lost output during recessions accompanied by a housing bust is double or triple what it might otherwise have been had real-estate prices held up . <eos>
moreover , housing busts tend to prolong recessions by almost three years . <eos>
given the enormous social and economic costs when high levels of mortgage debt meet a crash in house prices , one would expect regulators to be fully engaged on the issue . <eos>
unfortunately , they are not . <eos>
although the basel committee on banking supervision , the primary global benchmark for bank regulations , proposed reforms after the 2008 crisis that are aimed at strengthening the financial system , mortgage regulations have changed little . <eos>
the key to mortgage regulation is the concept of “ risk weight , ” a measure that increases with the probability that a borrower will default . <eos>
for example , a loan to aaa-rated microsoft has a 0% risk weight , meaning that it is virtually risk-free . <eos>
a loan to the indian government will have a risk weight of 50% , and one to a riskier argentina will be weighted at 150% . <eos>
when it comes to mortgages , the standard risk weight is 35% ( down from 50% a decade ago ) . <eos>
but banks can use internal mathematical models to calculate their own risk weights . <eos>
this is akin to marking one’s own exam paper; unsurprisingly , banks’ risk scores are usually on the safe side . <eos>
consider , for example , a $200 , 000 bank loan to buy a $235 , 000 home . <eos>
if the bank attaches a 10% risk weight to the loan , the risk-weighted equivalent is $20 , 000 . <eos>
if the amount of bank capital needed to protect that risk-weighted equivalent is 10% , then the bank requires just $2 , 000 of its own capital to fund the mortgage , $198 , 000 of which the bank itself borrows . <eos>
all it takes to wipe out the bank’s own money is a 16% drop in the house’s price ( from $235 , 000 to below $198 , 000 ) . <eos>
us house prices – as measured by the s&amp;p/case-shiller national home price index – fell by more than 30% from june 2006 to march 2009 , while european countries , including spain , ireland , and the united kingdom , experienced similar or greater declines . <eos>
the problem is that banks continue to offer big mortgages while having little of their own “ skin in the game . ” <eos>
the imf estimates that the average mortgage risk weight in europe and asia was 14% and 15% , respectively , with some banks using a risk weight as low as 6% . <eos>
recently , some regulators have become suspicious of banks’ do-it-yourself risk weights . <eos>
in 2012 , the uk authorities asked banks to apply a temporary minimum 15% risk weight to their mortgage portfolios , though that guidance expired in july . <eos>
the swedish regulator has recommended that mortgage lenders raise their risk-weight floor from 15% to 25% . <eos>
although welcome , these steps may still be too little; more important , they lack flexibility . <eos>
a better option would be to implement time-varying , pro-cyclical floors , forcing banks to hold more capital during housing booms . <eos>
and , whereas a single , fixed floor might push banks toward riskier loans that offer higher returns for the same amount of capital , a dynamic system would allow lower floors for the lowest-risk mortgages and require higher floors for riskier loans . <eos>
moreover , while risk weight is an important macro-prudential lever , it must be used in conjunction with regulators’ other tools . <eos>
these include mortgage eligibility criteria , such as loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios , and dynamic provisioning ( that is increasing banks’ mandatory loan-loss reserves during housing booms ) . <eos>
it is important to calibrate the impact of risk weights on housing-market cycles relative to other measures , not least because excessive and overlapping intervention could itself fuel dangerous cycles . <eos>
the reliance of modern banking regulation on risk weighting is nowhere more important than in the mortgage market . <eos>
if regulators get it wrong , the entire edifice could collapse – yet again . <eos>

hardening brazil’s soft power <eos>
brasilia – it is , perhaps , a truism for brazil’s citizens that their country is and always will be a peaceful one . <eos>
after all , brazil has lived with its ten neighbors without conflict for almost 150 years , having settled its borders through negotiation . <eos>
it last went to war in 1942 , after direct aggression by nazi u-boats in the south atlantic . <eos>
it has forsworn nuclear weapons , having signed a comprehensive nuclear-safeguards agreement with argentina and the international atomic energy agency . <eos>
through the common market of the south ( mercosur ) and the union of south american nations ( unasur ) , brazil is helping to integrate the region politically , economically , socially , and culturally . <eos>
but is soft power enough for one of the world’s major emerging countries ? <eos>
to be sure , brazil’s peaceful foreign policy has served it well . <eos>
brazil has used its stature to advance peace and cooperation in south america and beyond . <eos>
its constructive stance derives from a worldview that accords pride of place to the values of democracy , social justice , economic development , and environmental protection . <eos>
brazil’s unique approach to promoting these ideals is an important source of its soft power , reflected in the broad international support that placed brazilians atop international institutions like the food and agriculture organization and the world trade organization . <eos>
yet no country can rely on soft power alone to defend its interests . <eos>
indeed , in an unpredictable world , where old threats are compounded by new challenges , policymakers cannot disregard hard power . <eos>
by deterring threats to national sovereignty , military power supports peace; and , in brazil’s case , it underpins our country’s constructive role in the pursuit of global stability . <eos>
that role is more necessary than ever . <eos>
over the past two decades , unilateral actions in disregard of the un security council’s primary responsibility in matters of war and peace have led to greater uncertainty and instability . <eos>
likewise , little progress toward nuclear disarmament has been made , in disregard of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty . <eos>
brazil’s abundance of energy , food , water , and biodiversity increases its stake in a security environment characterized by rising competition for access to , or control of , natural resources . <eos>
in order to meet the challenges of this complex reality , brazil’s peaceful foreign policy must be supported by a robust defense policy . <eos>
brazil’s national defense strategy , updated in 2012 , states that the modernization of the armed forces is intrinsically linked to national development . <eos>
thus , it emphasizes the need to strengthen the domestic defense industry . <eos>
in accordance with the strategy , brazil is enhancing its conventional deterrence capabilities , including by building a nuclear-propelled submarine as part of a naval program commensurate with its responsibilities in the south atlantic . <eos>
brazil coordinates closely on defense matters with its neighbors , both bilaterally and through unasur’s south american defense council , which aims to promote confidence-building , transparency , a joint regional defense industry , and , most important , a common defense identity . <eos>
one potential mechanism for advancing these objectives is a south american defense college , now under consideration . <eos>
south america is becoming a region where war is unthinkable – what the political scientist karl deutsch once called a “ security community . ” <eos>
having visited every south american country in my tenure as defense minister , i am convinced that , the most effective deterrent on the continent is cooperation . <eos>
at the same time , brazil is pursuing increased bilateral defense cooperation with african partners . <eos>
with our neighbors on both shores of the south atlantic , brazil is working closely to strengthen the zone of peace and cooperation of the south atlantic ( zpcsa ) , which aims to keep the ocean free from rivalries foreign to it and from nuclear weapons . <eos>
brazil is also reaching out to other emerging countries , such as its fellow brics ( brazil , russia , india , china , and south africa ) and members of the ibsa dialogue forum ( india , brazil , and south africa ) . <eos>
for example , brazil conducts ibsamar , a regular trilateral naval exercise , with south africa and india . <eos>
more broadly , we are exploring ways to cooperate in the joint development of defense technologies . <eos>
through such endeavors , brazil hopes to contribute to a more balanced international order , one less subject to hegemonies of any kind , without losing sight of the importance of mutually beneficial partnerships with developed countries . <eos>
even as brazil hardens its soft power , it remains deeply committed to the path of dialogue , conflict prevention , and the negotiated settlement of disputes . <eos>
the presence of brazilian peacekeepers in countries like haiti and lebanon underscores brazil’s contribution to maintaining peace and security worldwide . <eos>
in the twenty-first century , a truly stable global order will depend on a legitimate and effective un security council , one that reflects the plurality of the emerging multipolar world . <eos>
china grows down <eos>
hong kong – for more than three decades , china’s gdp has grown by an average of more than 10% annually . <eos>
but former premier wen jiabao rightly described this impressive growth performance as “ unstable , unbalanced , uncoordinated , and unsustainable , ” highlighting the many economic , social , and environmental costs and challenges that have accompanied it . <eos>
now china must choose between the export-based , investment-driven growth model of the past and a new , more viable economic order . <eos>
cheap credit and perverse incentives – such as promotions for officials who contribute most to gdp growth – have led to massive but redundant investment , which , in turn , has contributed to excess capacity in manufacturing and infrastructure . <eos>
this model is not only inefficient; channeling government resources to support investment also undermines china’s social development . <eos>
given this , china’s leaders have decided to stop using gdp growth as the primary criterion for evaluating officials’ performance . <eos>
indeed , the 12th five-year plan , which extends until 2015 , aims to shift china’s economy to a new , more sustainable growth model based on quality and innovation , and accepts that annual gdp growth will likely fall to 7% during the transition . <eos>
most discussion of growth models nowadays is based on work by the nobel laureate robert solow . <eos>
for solow , gdp growth is determined by the factor inputs of land , labor , and capital , together with the economy’s total factor productivity ( tfp , or the change in output not accounted for by changes in the volume of inputs , but by factors like technological innovation and institutional reform ) . <eos>
since 1978 , china , by implementing major reforms , has achieved three periods of high tfp growth , each lasting 5-7 years . <eos>
first , in the early 1980’s , following the introduction of the rural household-responsibility system , which boosted agricultural productivity and released a large amount of unskilled labor to work in the higher-productivity urban and industrial sectors , annual tfp growth accelerated to 3-4% . <eos>
the second such period followed deng xiaoping’s southern tour in 1992 , during which he emphasized the need to shift to a market-based – albeit state-controlled – system by opening china’s economy to foreign direct investment and establishing special economic zones to help develop export-oriented industries . <eos>
this time , tfp growth soared to 5-6% , partly owing to the “ catching up ” process facilitated by china’s adoption of foreign technology and know-how . <eos>
finally , after major reforms of state-owned enterprises ( soes ) and the tax system , china acceded to the world trade organization in 2001 . with the country fully integrated into global supply chains , tfp growth hit 4% , where it remained until 2007 . <eos>
since then , however , the tfp growth rate has fallen by almost half . <eos>
indeed , china’s economy has experienced a significant – and ongoing – growth slowdown in the wake of the global economic crisis that erupted five years ago . <eos>
by 2012 , human capital’s contribution to china’s gdp growth fell almost to zero , with fixed-capital accumulation accounting for roughly 60% of total growth . <eos>
large-scale , debt-funded capital investments have raised the country’s credit/gdp ratio to nearly 200% , increasing the financial system’s vulnerability – a development reflected in the recent spike in interbank interest rates . <eos>
in order to achieve more balanced and sustainable gdp growth , china’s leaders must implement a set of deep , comprehensive , and long-lasting institutional reforms aimed at boosting tfp . <eos>
in particular , the reforms should be designed to facilitate china’s transition from its traditional supply-based growth model , which assumes that building hard infrastructure leads automatically to demand growth . <eos>
in fact , gdp growth may be slowing precisely because existing investment in manufacturing and infrastructure , undertaken largely by local governments and soes , does not match the pattern of domestic demand . <eos>
as a result , china now faces the problem of short-term excess capacity . <eos>
improving the quality of gdp growth will depend on chinese leaders’ willingness to enact market-oriented reforms . <eos>
rather than directly driving investment , the state must emphasize its regulatory and enforcement functions , including setting and overseeing standards , building an effective property-rights infrastructure , and managing macroeconomic conditions . <eos>
at the same time , the state must improve the quality and delivery of education , health care , and security , while minimizing corruption and administrative abuses . <eos>
in short , china must shift its focus from meeting gdp growth targets to creating an environment that fosters innovation and competition , thereby enabling market forces to set prices and allocate resources more effectively . <eos>
the state would thus become an intermediary agent , facilitating the development of a sustainable economic order in which less is more – that is , a system in which less intervention creates more opportunities for creativity . <eos>
soes undoubtedly played an important role in china’s previous growth model , delivering the infrastructure and services that were deemed necessary for the global manufacturing supply chain to function . <eos>
but access to cheap credit from state-controlled banks creates an incentive for soes to generate surplus capacity , which increases systemic risk in the economy . <eos>
to correct china’s excess-capacity problem would require the relevant enterprises , whether soes or private firms , to exit the market . <eos>
unless china’s leaders implement major structural reforms aimed at establishing a market-based growth model , they will be unable to avoid the “ middle-income trap ” that has prevented so many developing economies from attaining advanced-country status . <eos>
the deceleration in gdp growth that such reforms would cause would be more than offset by increased market dynamism and overall economic stability . <eos>
a murder in moscow <eos>
it is time to end the fiction that vladimir putin’s “ dictatorship of law ” has made postcommunist russia any less lawless . <eos>
the murder of anna politkovskaya , one of russia’s bravest and best journalists , a woman who dared to expose the brutal murders committed by russian troops in chechnya , is final proof that president putin has delivered nothing more than a run of the mill dictatorship with the usual contempt for law . <eos>
this recognition is a timely one for the world to make , particularly europe . <eos>
germany’s foreign ministry is preparing a policy on russian/german relations that will enshrine indifference to putin’s lawlessness as being in the national interest of the most powerful member of the european union . <eos>
but indifference becomes appeasement when it encourages putin to pursue his lawless ways in the international arena , as in his current campaign to strangle georgia’s economy . <eos>
the killing of politkovskaya has incited an eerie sense of déjà vu : just as in the kgb’s heyday , people simply disappear in putin’s russia . <eos>
politkovskaya’s is the third politically tinged killing in three weeks . <eos>
enver ziganshin , the chief engineer of bp russia , was shot to death in irkutsk on september 30 . <eos>
andrei kozlov , the deputy governor of russia’s central bank who was leading a campaign against financial fraud , was assassinated on september 14 . <eos>
the fact that russia’s prosecutor general yuri chaika , took over the investigation into politkovskaya’s killing , as he did with the murder of kozlov , doesn’t inspire hope , as such senior level involvement would in any real democracy . <eos>
in fact , the involvement of the highest level of russia’s government is almost a guarantee that the killers will never be found . <eos>
politkovskaya’s murder is a particularly grim augury when you consider that she was a powerful critic of russia’s president . <eos>
in her articles for one of the few remaining independent papers in moscow , <eos>
i am not accusing putin’s government of the contract killing of politkovskaya . <eos>
after all , as a campaigning investigative journalist she made many people angry besides putin , not least of which is the current chechen prime minister , ramzan kadyrov , whom she accused of a policy of kidnapping for ransom . <eos>
but even if vladimir putin’s associates had nothing to do with politkovskaya being gunned down in an elevator of her apartment building in the center of moscow , his contempt for law created the climate in which the murder was carried out . <eos>
like the murder of archbishop thomas beckett in his canterbury cathedral many centuries ago , the crime was committed in the clear belief that it would please the king . <eos>
given what politkovskaya represented—the responsibility of a democratic press to question the kremlin and its policies—the government should have made certain that nothing bad happened to her . <eos>
putin’s russia has already lost 12 leading journalists to murder in the past six years . <eos>
none of those crimes has been solved , which would not be the case if putin’s “ dictatorship of law ” was anything more than a pr strategy . <eos>
the six year period since vladimir putin arrived in the kremlin has been a time of deeply conflicting signals . <eos>
on one hand , the world sees a young , educated leader pledging to modernize russia , particularly in terms of bringing its law enforcement and judicial practices into line with international norms . <eos>
on the other , the president watches in silence while his ex-colleagues in russia's fsb security service ( the former kgb ) provide no security to those murdered , and launch a series of notorious espionage cases against journalists , scientists , and environmental activists . <eos>
these “ neo-spies ” include journalist gregory pasko , arms control expert igor sutyagin , diplomat valentin moiseyev , physicist valentin danilov , and others . <eos>
the supposedly civilizing influence of being a western partner — chairing a g-8 summit in saint petersburg for example — seems to have been lost on putin’s kremlin cabal . <eos>
once again exposure to western values has delivered another potemkin village; russia presents a façade of laws and democratic institutions , but behind that cardboard surface the same arbitrary brutes rule . <eos>
the danger for the world is that putin’s lawlessness is being exported . <eos>
across russia’s near abroad , a form of criminalized diplomacy is taking root . <eos>
look at putin’s attempt to rig ukraine’s previous presidential election , and the on again off again criminal charges brought against the opposition leader yuliya tymoshenko . <eos>
look at the rogue breakaway regions in moldova and georgia that exist only because of the kremlin’s backing . <eos>
look at how the kremlin seeks to blackmail its neighbors by threatening their energy supplies . <eos>
every policeman knows that when you ignore criminal behavior , criminals grow bolder . <eos>
it is past time for the world to recognize vladimir putin for what he is: a man who is taking russia back into the shadows . <eos>
so the world must now ponder that old latin maxim qui tacet consentere videtur – silence means consent – and ask itself if it is wise to quietly consent to putin’s construction of a lawless energy superpower . <eos>
an accidental cure for iraq <eos>
doctors use the word “ crisis ” to describe the point at which a patient either starts to recover or dies . <eos>
president george w . bush’s iraqi patient now seems to have reached that point . <eos>
most commentators appear to think that bush’s latest prescription – a surge of 20 , 000 additional troops to suppress the militias in baghdad – will , at best , merely postpone the inevitable death of his dream of a democratic iraq . <eos>
yet as “ battle of baghdad ” begins , factors beyond bush’s control and not of his making ( at least not intentionally ) may just save iraq from its doom . <eos>
one key factor is that , for the first time since the united states and britain invaded iraq , arab sunni leaders are backing a us military plan for that country . <eos>
these sunni leaders live in abject fear of the geopolitical earthquake that any disintegration of political authority in baghdad would bring , believing that all-out civil war would invariably follow – a war that would not respect international borders . <eos>
of course , america has been encouraging sunni leaders in this belief . <eos>
secretary of state condoleezza rice’s recent tour of middle east capitals helped spread the word to egypt , jordan , saudi arabia , and the gulf states that any us failure and sudden withdrawal would be certain to destabilize them . <eos>
given the fragile grip that these leaders have over their societies , america’s warnings have been taken to heart . <eos>
but the truly curious factor that might bring success to bush is that those who have opposed or resented america’s presence in iraq , such as the iranian-backed shi’a parties now also appear to want bush’s new strategy to succeed . <eos>
they are for it because they believe it will defang moqtada al-sadr , the rogue shi’a cleric whose power has mushroomed over the past three years – to the point that he now dominates much of baghdad and holds the allegiance of countless angry young shi’a men . <eos>
of course , attacking moqtada al-sadr’s mahdi army in the name of fighting militia death squads has the potential to draw american military forces into a level of urban warfare unseen since the falluja assaults of 2004 and 2005 . <eos>
al-sadr is seen as the protector of the shi’a of iraq and has are an estimated 60 , 000 fighters in his militia . <eos>
but he is deeply mistrusted by other shi’a leaders , who fear that they may one day have to take him on by themselves . <eos>
better to let the americans do it , though of course these shi’a leaders prefer a slow strangulation of al-sadr to a direct and bloody assault . <eos>
but make no mistake: how al-sadr is handled is the big test of bush’s new strategy . <eos>
should the us choose to face al-sadr and his forces head on , they risk alienating iraq’s largest sectarian community , the shi’a , adding fuel to the anti-occupation resistance and thus probably dooming bush to failure . <eos>
iran and syria , which have played a spoiler role in iraq up to now , may also now be anxious to find a way to pull the country back from the brink . <eos>
bush still refuses to talk to either of them , and has lately been having us troops arrest iranian agents in iraq . <eos>
yet iran may already see itself as victorious , with the current iraqi government friendlier than any the iranians have ever known . <eos>
so maintaining that government in office has now become a strategic priority for iran , particularly as it is now clear that any us hopes of using iraq as a permanent military base are dead . <eos>
the “ surge ” also opens , perhaps for the first time , a serious possibility of pouring water on the insurgent fires in anbar province , the heartland of the sunni insurgency . <eos>
the us has achieved relative successes in the province through alliances with sunni tribes . <eos>
the hope is that such realistic and pragmatic accommodations will be extended to iraqis who are fighting under the banner of a nationalist and anti-occupation agenda . <eos>
so some of the stars have come into alignment for bush . <eos>
but to keep them there in the long term , the iraqi government will need to amend the constitution in a way that appeases the sunni community . <eos>
reassuring iraq’s sunnis that they have a place in the new iraq will also reassure neighboring sunni governments , which have mostly turned a blind eye to the support for the insurgency that has come from their lands . <eos>
of course , should the us see failure ahead , it could seek to broaden the war beyond iraq’s borders by attacking iran , a policy reminiscent of “ operation sideshow , ” when us failure in vietnam in the late 1960’s enticed president nixon into attacking cambodia and laos . <eos>
but iran has resources that cambodia and laos could never muster; indeed , its ability to retaliate could set the entire region ablaze . <eos>
whereas america’s war in indochina was a tragic mistake , the cost of a wider war precipitated by the crisis in iraq would be incomparably greater – for both the patient and the doctor . <eos>
an agenda for growth in europe <eos>
a recent oecd study reminds us , once again , that per capita income levels are roughly 30% lower in the euro area , as well as in the three largest continental countries – france , germany , and italy – that dominate its performance , than in the united states . <eos>
that gap is likely to widen as europe’s demographic profile darkens , and if productivity continues to grow more slowly than elsewhere in the industrial economies . <eos>
why have the large european economies failed to catch up with us income levels ? <eos>
the bulk of the shortfall is due to less intensive use of labor: employment rates for women and for the oldest and youngest age groups are lower in the euro area than in the us , working hours are far fewer , and , least significantly , unemployment rates are higher . <eos>
some take consolation from this , viewing it as positive that europeans prefer leisure to work . <eos>
but low levels of labor utilization are largely due to heavier income taxes and social security contributions , as well as high social benefit levels introduced at a time when the labor force was growing rapidly and the need to replace involuntary with voluntary unemployment seemed more urgent than today . <eos>
these measures will need to be revisited both to increase the supply of labor and to make public finances more sustainable . <eos>
this process is already underway , particularly in italy and france , through cuts in social security contributions for lower-paid workers , tighter conditions for drawing unemployment benefits , and tax credits for “ the working poor . ” <eos>
since the mid-1990’s , the relative decline in employment in these countries has , indeed , been slightly reversed . <eos>
but factors beyond taxes and benefits also contribute to low employment rates in all the three major euro-zone economies: high minimum wages and some features of employment protection legislation slow down the flow of workers through the job market . <eos>
although a long agenda of reforms is beginning to be tackled , first in germany and , more recently and cautiously , in france , the results are slow in coming and public understanding of the need for change remains limited . <eos>
much can be learned from each country’s experience and from that of smaller eu member states , but labor market reforms inevitably have a strong national flavor . <eos>
employment objectives have been formulated for all eu member states since 1997 in the so-called european employment strategy ( ees ) , now part of the “ lisbon agenda , ” the set of goals established to boost eu productivity . <eos>
but , with the policy instruments for achieving these goals largely national and the arguments for applying them simultaneously in several member states weak , the ees has created unrealistic public expectations and triggered only limited action by governments . <eos>
nor is the employment gap with the us the only problem for europe . <eos>
beginning in the mid-1990’s , the rate of growth in output per hour worked – a key factor behind the rise in per capita income – slowed in most european countries while it rose in the us , reversing a decades-long pattern . <eos>
between 2000 and 2004 , hourly labor productivity rose more than twice as fast in the us than in the large euro zone economies – 2 . 8% per year versus little more than 1% . <eos>
so why have the europeans been unable to sustain improvements in both foundations of growth – employment and productivity – at the same time ? <eos>
this proved possible not only in the us , but also in other advanced economies outside europe – australia , canada , and new zealand – and , unsurprisingly , in the new eu member states . <eos>
the explanation is not capital spending , which is normally linked to productivity growth . <eos>
there have been no major differences between the us and the large euro zone economies here . <eos>
this leaves the “ explanation ” to what economists call total factor productivity ( tfp ) , a mix of several important elements , including innovation activity , a well-functioning financial system ready and willing to take risks , and organizational flexibility that facilitates rapid diffusion of new technologies . <eos>
the main lapse in tfp growth in europe over the past decade has been in services ( excluding information and communications technologies ) . <eos>
so deregulation and integration of services will be essential if the euro area’s tfp is to improve , as more than two-thirds of total income in most eu economies is generated in this sector . <eos>
while product markets have held center stage in the creation of the single european market , services continue to be fragmented by national regulatory , anti-competitive practices . <eos>
much of the explanation lies in the very heterogeneity of services and the greater difficulties that mutual recognition , or the “ country-of-origin principle ” – essential in the integration of product markets – implies for services . <eos>
unfortunately , reform was derailed in 2005 . <eos>
during the referendum campaign in france preceding the vote on the draft eu constitutional treaty , the proposed directive was vilified as undermining the rights of labor , symbolized by that dreaded bogeyman , the “ polish plumber . ” <eos>
these attacks overlooked the fact that the directive makes employment conditions of workers from other eu-member states subject in most respects to host-country rules . <eos>
a revised version of the directive that reduces its sectoral scope and makes a number of compromises with the country-of-origin principle is now before the european parliament . <eos>
even this limited version would constitute progress; most of the gains arise from removing the red tape that complicates cross-border establishment of small and medium-size service enterprises and limits competition in broad sectors of the economy . <eos>
it is a sad reflection on the state of the eu that it seems unable to agree on the one clear productivity-advancing piece of legislation when improving productivity is held out as a shared goal . <eos>
the failure to mobilize consumer interests in favor of european integration is particularly disappointing for the new member states , which had expected to reap some of the benefits . <eos>
an alliance of civilizations ? <eos>
madrid – the first international forum of the alliance of civilizations , conceived as an antidote to the idea that the world is doomed to a “ clash of civilizations , ” recently met in madrid and revealed that there is more than a grain of truth in robert kagan’s idea that americans are from mars and europeans from venus . <eos>
ever since september 11 , 2001 , the united states has been engaged in a crusade against the forces of evil in the muslim world . <eos>
by contrast , the march 11 , 2004 , terrorist attack on spain , which left 200 dead , triggered an “ anti-crusade ” that seeks to disarm extremism by building bridges of understanding and reconciliation with islam . <eos>
co-sponsored by spain and turkey , the alliance of civilizations initiative is not devoid of political calculation . <eos>
to the spaniards , it helps to justify their abrupt withdrawal from iraq in 2004; for the turks , it is yet another vehicle in their struggle , as the vital bridge between islam and the west , for admission into the european union . <eos>
a loose and somewhat confused project , the alliance of civilizations aims to heal the wounds of conflict between islam and the west through education , viable integration policies , and a better-informed dialogue with the media . <eos>
but it suffers from the major global players’ profound skepticism , with the us , russia , and , for that matter , the eu shown no real enthusiasm for it . <eos>
however vague , the alliance of civilizations idea certainly cannot do more harm than war against islamic extremism . <eos>
after all , none of the muslim world’s problems and conflicts with the west are susceptible to a military solution . <eos>
moreover , the alliance is not an entirely incoherent proposal if the objective is that the west disengage from the politics of hubris and establish a genuine sphere of cooperation with the muslim world in economics , culture , and science . <eos>
of course , the idea is held back by the inner workings of both parts of the proposed alliance . <eos>
many in the west question whether islam is compatible with human rights and western concepts of liberty . <eos>
many muslims who have been fighting for years for  their countries’ modernization have so far failed to find a lucid response to the progressive wave of radical islam . <eos>
to claim that islam is incompatible with human rights is to consider it a civilization too hidebound to change . <eos>
this is a historic fallacy . <eos>
nor is the claim that islam is intrinsically inimical to innovation viable , because muslim civilization has contributed mightily to science and art throughout history . <eos>
today , western universities are replete with distinguished arab scholars in almost every field – the result of a brain drain that itself reflects the islamic world’s centuries of decline . <eos>
in 2005 , the 17 countries of the arab world together produced 13 , 444 scientific publications , fewer than the 15 , 455 achieved by harvard university alone . <eos>
enemies of reason , however , are also to be found in the west . <eos>
we live in an age in which many people are disillusioned with secular politics , and are turning to religion instead , not only throughout the muslim world , but in the core of western civilization , christian europe and evangelist america . <eos>
nor is the jewish state of israel , where messianic fanatics and religious nationalists have embraced a political theology that questions the very legitimacy of the democratic institutions , immune from this phenomenon . <eos>
the current crisis of islam might not be congenital , but islam’s predicament is acute . <eos>
the question is this: are muslims ready to accept that khomeini’s dictum that “ islam is politics or it is nothing ” is wrong , that islam is a religion and not a form of government , and that , as in the christian world , there is a sphere for caesar and a sphere for god ? <eos>
those in the muslim world who want to embrace reform must be driven by the conviction that theocracy has never served as a vehicle for human progress . <eos>
of course , the alliance of civilizations should not attempt to bridge differences by defending moral relativism . <eos>
if it is driven by a western guilt complex that assumes that the solution simply lies in greater empathy for the muslim predicament , then the skeptics are bound to be vindicated . <eos>
for the alliance of civilizations to have any chance of success , the emphasis must be on reciprocity . <eos>
tolerance and religious freedom must be mutual . <eos>
islam’s part in the deal must include a guarantee of human rights and civil liberties , improvement in women’s status , and realistic policies to stem the islamic world’s demographic explosion . <eos>
some , as usual , will claim that the arab-israeli conflict lies at the root of the problems that exist between islam and the west , and that resolving the palestinians’ plight will contribute immensely to smoother relations . <eos>
but arabs and muslims must stop deluding themselves that the israel-palestine dispute is what is holding them back . <eos>
ending the american occupation in iraq and imposing an arab-israeli peace would help , but they are no panacea . <eos>
the fight to eradicate misery , illiteracy , and corruption , and islam’s embrace of science , do not depend on the results of the middle east peace process . <eos>
an alliance of equals <eos>
paris – during nato’s recent 60th anniversary ceremony in strasbourg , the alliance welcomed two new members , albania and croatia , bringing its total membership to 28 . <eos>
this expansion is a good thing , for history has tormented these two countries . <eos>
being welcomed within the great international family of the west will reassure them , stabilize them , and contribute to their political , cultural , and economic development . <eos>
but the good news was limited , because nato addressed only a routine agenda . <eos>
no core problem was really tackled . <eos>
the controversy that arose in france over the country’s return to nato’s unified military command makes this abundantly clear . <eos>
was france losing its autonomy , perhaps even its sovereignty ? <eos>
was it capitulating to american hegemony ? <eos>
these are real questions , yet at the nato summit people spoke of them more in terms of symbols than as realities . <eos>
but what is the reality here ? <eos>
nato is a military alliance composed of 28 countries . <eos>
one of them , the united states , has a military budget that is more than three times that of all the other members combined . <eos>
hence , the us runs most nato civilian and military commands with the consent of the others . <eos>
of course , there is a collective consultation and deliberative process that enables any member to be heard . <eos>
but in reality a member’s actual power is what affects common decisions . <eos>
this structure harks back to the conditions of nato’s birth , when it was forged to thwart the soviet threat to western civilization . <eos>
at the time , no one ever doubted that american power – already endowed with nuclear weapons – was the only counterpart . <eos>
for this reason , the us came to preside over the alliance . <eos>
during the 41 years of the cold war , 14 of nato’s 16 members strictly obeyed and complied with american decisions and policies . <eos>
french president charles de gaulle was the only one to question whether an american president would actually ever be ready to launch a nuclear attack on the ussr in order to protect one or several alliance members if vital us interests were not directly at stake . <eos>
based on that doubt , france – a nuclear power since 1960 – withdrew in 1966 from the alliance’s permanent centralized military command in order to assert its own deterrent capability . <eos>
this decision was mainly grounded on the american doctrine , adopted in 1962 , of “ flexible response , ” which said to the soviets: “ as long as you do not use nuclear weapons , we will not use them , either . ” <eos>
this very doctrine left europe exposed . <eos>
indeed , while it is a much disputed question , de gaulle was probably right about america’s lack of commitment to the nuclear defense of europe . <eos>
both henry kissinger and robert mcnamara left office admitting that de gaulle had been correct . <eos>
nevertheless , de gaulle’s insights left a legacy that still causes some mistrust and dissent within nato . <eos>
france was right on this key strategic point , but it was never able to explain its position to its allies . <eos>
this inability to discuss , clearly and forthrightly , this strategic doctrine continues to hamper the alliance . <eos>
at the strasbourg summit , confidence in the future could have been strengthened if a couple of troubling issues had been discussed . <eos>
instead , once again , there was an extended focus on the past . <eos>
the key questions are whether nato’s doctrine of common defense is currently directed at one country in particular , and whether nuclear force remains the alliance’s major defensive tool . <eos>
in the current global situation , no predictable conflict will require the use of a nuclear weapon . <eos>
at the moment , there is no global threat and the alliance only intervenes in regional conflicts , so why not have nato admit this ? <eos>
but the most important matter that went unmentioned in strasbourg is the relationship with russia . <eos>
nato was founded to confront the threat that the ussr represented 60 years ago . <eos>
but the warsaw pact , the soviet union’s “ anti-nato ” alliance of socialist countries , was dissolved in 1991; communism imploded the same year , with russia caught ever since in a struggle to build a market economy and define a new global position for itself . <eos>
at a time when russia was taking a more pacific course , nato – unlike the warsaw pact – was not dismantled . <eos>
on the contrary , the allies chose to maintain the pact and to extend it to numerous russian neighbors . <eos>
nato’s members essentially said: “ we western nations do not trust you . even if you become a democracy , we will always be suspicious . ” <eos>
george kennan , one of the greatest american diplomats of the post-war years , once wrote that the western world was committing its biggest mistake in 50 years time by expanding nato after soviet communism collapsed . <eos>
the resulting humiliation and blatant mistrust that russia’s elite has felt ever since has led them to their current policy of rearmament . <eos>
the only way to resolve this problem is for nato to assert its pacific intentions before the world . <eos>
the most convincing way to do that is to moderate america’s excessive taste for power , which it demonstrated in iraq . <eos>
nato needs to shift its focus from organizing and administering a unified military command to building real confidence that every member’s voice will be heard . <eos>
to that end , all members must stand on an equal footing . <eos>
france’s decision to return to full and equal alliance membership was a good one , and france must now work from within to advance the principles in which it believes . <eos>
avoiding a new american recession <eos>
cambridge – the united states may be headed for a recession in 2013 . <eos>
even if the country avoids going over the “ fiscal cliff , ” a poorly designed political compromise that cuts the deficit too quickly could push an already weak economy into recession . <eos>
but a gradual phase-in of an overall cap on tax deductions and exclusions ( so-called tax expenditures ) , combined with reform of entitlement spending , could achieve the long-run fiscal consolidation that america needs without risking a new recession . <eos>
the us economy has been limping along with a growth rate of less than 2% during the past year , with similarly dim prospects in 2013 , even without the shock of the fiscal cliff . &#160; that is much too weak a pace of expansion to tolerate the fiscal cliff’s increase in tax rates and spending cuts , which would reduce demand by a total of $600 billion – about 4% of gdp – next year , and by larger sums in subsequent years . <eos>
president barack obama’s proposed alternative to the fiscal cliff would substantially increase tax rates and limit tax deductions for the top 2% of earners , who now pay more than 45% of total federal personal-income taxes . <eos>
his budget would also increase taxes on corporations , and would end the current payroll-tax “ holiday , ” imposing an additional 2% tax on all wage earners . <eos>
together , these changes could lower total demand by nearly 2% of gdp . <eos>
and the higher marginal tax rates would reduce incentives to work and to invest , further impeding economic activity . <eos>
all of that could be fateful for an economy that is still struggling to sustain a growth rate of less than 2% . <eos>
the congressional budget office and the federal reserve predict that going over the fiscal cliff would cause a recession in 2013 , with fed chairman ben bernanke recently saying that the fed would be unable to offset the adverse effect on the economy . <eos>
he could have said the same thing about the fiscal drag that would be created by obama’s budget proposal . <eos>
although congressional republicans rightly object to raising tax rates , they appear willing to raise revenue through tax reform if that is part of a deal that also includes reductions in the long-run cost of the major entitlement programs , medicare and social security . <eos>
although some republicans would like to see revenue increased only by stimulating faster economic growth , that cannot be achieved without the reductions in marginal tax rates and improvements in corporate taxation that the democrats are unlikely to accept . <eos>
raising revenue through tax reform will have to mean reducing the special deductions and exclusions that now lower tax receipts . <eos>
the potential recession risk of a budget deal can be avoided by phasing in the base-broadening that is used to raise revenue . <eos>
a desirable way to broaden the tax base would be to put an overall cap on the amount of tax reduction that each taxpayer can achieve through deductions and exclusions . <eos>
such an overall cap would allow each taxpayer to retain all of his existing deductions and exclusions but would limit the amount by which he could reduce his tax liability in this way . <eos>
an overall cap would also cause many individuals who now itemize deductions to shift to the standard deduction – implying significant simplification in record-keeping and thus an improvement in incentives . <eos>
a cap on the tax reductions derived from tax expenditures that is equal to 2% of each individual’s adjusted gross income would raise more than $200 billion in 2013 if applied to all of the current deductions and to the exclusions for municipal-bond interest and employer-paid health insurance . <eos>
even if the full deduction for charitable gifts is preserved and only high-value health insurance is regarded as a tax expenditure , the extra revenue in 2013 would be about $150 billion . <eos>
over a decade , that implies nearly $2 trillion in additional revenue without any increase in tax rates from today’s levels . <eos>
extra revenue of $150 billion in 2013 would be 1% of gdp , and could be too much for the economy to swallow , particularly if combined with reductions in government spending and a rise in the payroll tax . <eos>
but the same basic framework could be used by starting with a higher cap and gradually reducing it over several years . <eos>
a 5% cap on the tax-expenditure benefits would raise only $75 billion in 2013 , about 0 . 5% of gdp; but the cap could be reduced from 5% to 2% over the next few years , raising substantially more revenue when the economy is stronger . <eos>
slowing the growth of government spending for medicare and social security is necessary to prevent a long-term explosion of the national debt or dramatic increases in personal tax rates . <eos>
those changes should also be phased in gradually to protect beneficiaries and avoid an economic downturn . <eos>
america’s national debt has more than doubled in the past five years , and is set to rise to more than 100% of gdp over the next decade unless changes in spending and taxes are implemented . <eos>
a well-designed combination of caps to limit tax expenditures and a gradual slowing of growth in outlays for entitlement programs could reverse the rise in the debt and strengthen the us economy . <eos>
america’s current budget negotiations should focus on achieving a credible long-term decline in the national debt , while protecting economic expansion in the near term . <eos>
an arab “ third way ” <eos>
amman – throughout the post-colonial period , arab countries have consistently failed to produce an efficient – let alone democratic – system of government . <eos>
now , after a half-century of competition between military or royal dictatorships and militant islamist regimes , many arabs are again seeking a “ third way ” – a path toward a credible form of representative democracy . <eos>
but will their efforts prove as futile now as they have in the past ? <eos>
the middle east – named for its geographic position between europe and east asia – was under ottoman rule for 400 years before the allied powers , after defeating the ottomans in world war i , partitioned the region into distinct political units that , under the sykes-picot agreement , fell within spheres of influence carved out by the united kingdom and france . <eos>
but , in response to these new divisions , an arab awakening – shaped by pan-arabism and support for palestine – was occurring . <eos>
charismatic young military rulers-turned-dictators like egypt’s gamal abdel nasser , iraq’s saddam hussein , libya’s muammar el-qaddafi , yemen’s ali abdullah saleh , and syria’s hafez al-assad used these popular causes to win public support . <eos>
but their failure to deliver better lives to their citizens , together with the discrediting of left-wing ideologies following the soviet union’s collapse , fueled the rise of a rival movement: political islam . <eos>
the muslim brotherhood – established in the egyptian town of ismailia in 1928 and political islam’s oldest , best organized , and most widespread proponent – was ( and is ) despised by both secular arabs and arab monarchies . <eos>
indeed , secular dictators have worked to suppress the brothers at every turn – often violently , as when assad ruthlessly crushed a brotherhood-led uprising in hama in 1982 . <eos>
forced to operate clandestinely , the brotherhood built its support base with a social agenda that targeted the needs of the poor , while consistently reinforcing its islamic ties , even using the compulsory zakat ( annual financial contribution to religious causes ) to build up its social network . <eos>
the brothers , with the help of a conservative society and the mosques , were prepared to seize power whenever the opportunity arose . <eos>
another islamist movement , algeria’s islamic salvation front , almost had such an opportunity in 1991 , when it won the first round of a general election . <eos>
but the military prevented its victory by canceling the second round , triggering a brutal eight-year civil war in which an estimated 200 , 000 people died . <eos>
palestine’s hamas , an offshoot of the brotherhood , succeeded at the ballot box in 2006 , but has since failed to deliver credible governance . <eos>
then the arab spring erupted in 2011 , creating new opportunities for political renewal . <eos>
within months , islamist parties shaped by the brotherhood’s ideology had replaced secular dictators in tunisia and egypt , and seemed poised to take over yemen and syria , largely because they were the only well-organized political movements on the scene . <eos>
moreover , the muslim brotherhood gained control of egypt , the largest and most influential of the arab spring countries . <eos>
but their exclusive , rigid ideology was poorly suited to governing such a large and diverse country . <eos>
as a result , after only a year in power , the military – backed by the same secular , liberal young people who had opposed it in 2011 – drove president mohamed morsi out of power . <eos>
unable to mount a political alternative , however , the protesters’ rejection of the islamist government served only to put the army back in charge . <eos>
some argue that the absence of a secular liberal option in arab politics stems from fear of political islam . <eos>
for decades , western powers backed military regimes in the arab world , willingly ignoring their systematic repression of democratic movements and rights , in order to ensure that islamists did not gain power . <eos>
now that both the military- and islamist-led systems have been discredited , an ideological vacuum has appeared in arab politics . <eos>
but arabs today – most of whom are under the age of 30 – are less interested in an overarching political ideology than they are in an efficient representative government that implements sound policies aimed at creating jobs and bolstering economic growth . <eos>
in short , they want a government that is focused on improving citizens’ lives . <eos>
in fact , the absence of a specific ideology was essential to the arab spring’s initial success in egypt and tunisia , for it allowed a large number of young activists to forge loose alliances . <eos>
but mass movements can take a country only so far; establishing a credible representative government requires political parties organized around clearly defined principles . <eos>
while the muslim brotherhood has such an organizing principle , its internal rigidity – at least with morsi at its helm – made it unfit to govern . <eos>
meanwhile , infighting among egypt’s liberals prevented them from establishing a disciplined , reliable alternative to the brotherhood based on principles like diversity , plurality , respect for women , and freedom of expression . <eos>
so when the islamist government’s credibility collapsed , the military was egypt’s only remaining option . <eos>
in order to make progress , the youth-led movements that drove the arab spring must translate their shared principles into effective political structures , and choose leaders who are capable of placing the search for consensus ahead of personal ambition . <eos>
if they succeed , the arab world may finally have an alternative to rule by generals or mullahs . <eos>
even if they fail to gain power , the emergence of such an alternative would surely influence the arab world’s agenda for years to come . <eos>
an american oil spill <eos>
singapore – when accidents happen , there is always enough blame to go around , and with the deepwater horizon oil spill in the gulf of mexico , no one has been spared – with the exception of one of the main culprits , the american public . <eos>
within a few hours of the accident , critics trained their sights on all the usual suspects: the minerals management service , for giving bp a pass on routine inspections and lapsing into a relationship with the oil industry that united states president barack obama denounced as “ cozy ” ; obama himself , for having failed to enact the reforms at the interior department that he had promised while campaigning for election; the oil services firm transocean , for the faulty blowout preventer; and , of course , bp , for a “ lax ” and even “ reckless ” safety culture . <eos>
after weeks of swirling wrath , primary responsibility eventually landed on bp’s shoulders . <eos>
at hearings before a us senate subcommittee , bp ceo tony hayward’s evasive maneuvering and failure to answer point-blank questions infuriated congressmen and the american public alike . <eos>
his expression of “ contrition ” may provide some relief that the key culprit has been fingered , but it brought the sealing of the well no closer . <eos>
furthermore , the situation in the gulf of mexico is worsening .   oil is not leaking at the rate of 1 , 000 barrels per day , as bp originally estimated , nor up to 19 , 000 bpd , as calculated by the flow rate technical group . <eos>
as a newly released bp internal document revealed , the actual flow is up to 100 , 000 bpd . <eos>
while there is no denying that the accident will create a long list of victims – the residents of the gulf states being among the worst affected – the american public also is to blame . <eos>
an historical addiction to cheap gasoline , and opposition to energy reform as “ un-american , ” has fueled an obsession with drilling , damming , and digging the country’s way out of problems . <eos>
this emphasis on the supply side ( increasing access to energy fuel ) has obscured cheaper and possibly more beneficial actions on the demand side ( cutting energy consumption by changing people’s behavior ) . <eos>
for example , while americans could have supported more aggressive fuel-economy standards or increased federal taxes on energy , they didn’t . <eos>
under the illusion that lifestyles revolving around cheap oil and big cars were america’s perennial right , fuel-economy standards languished for decades , and politicians avoided the t-word like the plague . <eos>
all the while , americans have been enjoying the cheapest gasoline in the developed world . <eos>
the country failed to anticipate the rise of china and india , whose exponential demand growth would have obvious implications for global energy prices . <eos>
instead , the supply-demand gap has been partly bridged by increasingly sophisticated engineering techniques . <eos>
technical feats like three-dimensional seismic imaging and tube-rotary drilling are no doubt impressive , but they are problematic when unaccompanied by adequate emergency-response plans or the regulatory oversight needed to ensure that accidents are prevented and mitigated . <eos>
this is plain to see today , and it resulted in obama’s knee-jerk imposition of a moratorium on deepwater drilling permits and suspension of existing projects in the gulf of mexico . <eos>
while a regulatory overhaul of offshore drilling procedures and policies is clearly necessary , it will be insufficient to reduce the risk of spills and accidents if it is not accompanied by other demand-side measures . <eos>
for example , now is the time to begin reducing us oil demand through improved fuel-economy standards and/or progressive increases in fuel taxes . <eos>
both may be necessary , because , while average fuel economy has made slight gains in recent years , the longer distances that people are traveling have offset any improvement . <eos>
the government also could start aggressively pushing a shift to electric vehicles . <eos>
in terms of total lifecycle costs , these vehicles are three to six times more energy-efficient than their petroleum counterparts . <eos>
people could make even simpler changes to their lifestyles by properly inflating their tires , driving more slowly on the highway – a car is most fuel efficient at about 55 miles ( 90 kilometers ) per hour – and abandoning their suvs . <eos>
the mantra of “ opportunity found in crisis ” has been uttered endlessly over the course of the deepwater horizon disaster . but seizing that opportunity requires moving past blame , learning from mistakes , and identifying how best to achieve a sensible , long-term national energy policy . <eos>
if americans want a future without other deepwater horizon-style accidents and oil-tarred wildlife , they must reduce oil demand , in addition to ensuring that oil production is carried out responsibly and safely . <eos>
an answer to the russian challenge <eos>
berlin – for 19 years , the west ( america and europe ) has been putting off answering a critical strategic question: what role should post-soviet russia actually play globally and in the european order ? <eos>
should it be treated as a difficult partner or a strategic adversary ? <eos>
even when this choice became critically acute during the crisis of russia’s short war against georgia last summer , the west didn’t provide a conclusive answer to this question . <eos>
if you follow most east europeans , the united kingdom and the bush administration , the answer is “ strategic adversary . ” <eos>
but most west europeans prefer “ difficult partner . ” <eos>
these seemingly mutually exclusive alternatives have one thing in common: neither of them has been thought through to the end . <eos>
if you see russia as a strategic adversary – and the restoration of great russian power politics under vladimir putin , to the detriment of the rule of law in domestic and foreign policy , does indeed speak for it – then the west should fundamentally change its agenda . <eos>
while russia is no longer the superpower it was in the soviet era , militarily it is still a great power , at least in europe and asia . <eos>
to address the numerous regional conflicts ( iran , middle east , afghanistan/pakistan , central asia , north korea ) and global challenges ( climate protection , disarmament , arms control , nuclear anti-proliferation , energy security ) that have high priority on the western agenda , cooperation with russia is necessary . <eos>
a strategic confrontation with moscow , i . e . , a new kind of “ mini-cold war , ” would undermine this agenda , or at least complicate its implementation significantly . <eos>
so the question is simply whether the threat emanating from russia is so grave that this kind of strategic reorientation on the part of the west is required ? <eos>
i believe it is not . <eos>
putin’s claim to great-power status and his great-power policies are structurally very vulnerable . <eos>
this is especially true at times where the price of oil has fallen below $40 per barrel . <eos>
and he knows that . <eos>
demographically , russia is in a dramatic nose-dive; it remains economically and socially backward; its infrastructure is underdeveloped , as are its investments in education and vocational training . <eos>
economically , it mainly relies on energy and commodity exports , and in its modernization efforts , it is largely dependent on the west , particularly europe . <eos>
due to its geopolitical position and its potential , however , russia will remain a permanent strategic factor in europe and asia that cannot be ignored . <eos>
to integrate the country into a strategic partnership is therefore in the west’s interest . <eos>
but this would require a western policy based on long-term thinking and a self-confident and strong power position , because the kremlin will perceive any sign of division and weakness as encouragement to return to great russian power politics . <eos>
a few months ago , the russian government came up with a proposal to negotiate a new european order within the framework of the organization for security and cooperation in europe . <eos>
russia considers the agreements from the 1990’s unjust , based as they were on its weakness at the time , and it wants to revise them . <eos>
moscow’s main strategic objective is the weakening or even roll-back of nato as an ant-russian military alliance and the re-establishment of its east european and central asian zones of influence . <eos>
but putin is making a big mistake here , because all these aims are unacceptable for the west , and the kremlin still doesn’t seem to understand that the best and most effective guarantee of nato’s existence was , is , and will continue to be an aggressive russian foreign policy . <eos>
in the former mother country of marxism-leninism , the leaders still don’t seem to understand dialectics . <eos>
after all , if russia’s government really wanted to achieve a change in the post-soviet status quo , it should , first and foremost , pursue a policy vis-à-vis its neighbors that reduces rather than increases fears . <eos>
but this applies similarly , if in reverse , to the west: on the one hand , the principles of a new europe as defined by the osce after 1989/1990 don’t allow decisions about alliances to be subject to the veto of a large neighbor . <eos>
the same is true for free and secret elections and the inviolability of borders . <eos>
on the other hand , the missile defense systems in poland and the czech republic , and the prospect of nato accession for georgia and ukraine , assume confrontation where this was not at all necessary . <eos>
the west should not reject russia’s wish for new negotiations on a european security system . <eos>
instead , it should be viewed as an opportunity finally to answer the key question of russia’s place within europe . <eos>
nato must play the central role here , because it is indispensable for the vast majority of europeans and for america . <eos>
the possible trade-off could be that the existing principles and institutions of the post-soviet european order , including nato , remain unchanged and are accepted and implemented by russia , which would get a significantly enhanced role within nato , including the perspective of full membership . <eos>
the peripheral nature of the nato-russia council was clearly not enough and did not work . <eos>
but why not think about transforming nato into a real european security system , including russia ? <eos>
the rules of the game would be changed and a whole variety of strategic goals could be achieved – european security , neighborhood conflicts , energy security , arms reduction , anti-proliferation , etc . <eos>
yes , such a bold step would transform nato . <eos>
but it would transform russia even more . <eos>
if the west approaches these discussions with russia without illusions , with a clear understanding of its own strategic interests , and with new ideas for partnership and cooperation , the worst to be feared is failure . <eos>
of course , this approach presupposes two things that don’t exist at the moment: a common transatlantic approach to dealing with russia , and a european union that acts in much greater unison and is therefore stronger . <eos>
nonetheless , the challenge posed by russia does not allow any further procrastination . <eos>
there is simply too much at stake . <eos>
insecure europe <eos>
madrid – for the last five years , europe has been shaken by financial and economic convulsions that have wreaked havoc on many of its citizens’ livelihoods . <eos>
the good news is that progress is finally being made in redeveloping the european union’s economic and monetary architecture , which should help to bring about a return to growth . <eos>
but eu leaders’ focus on internal problems has caused them largely to neglect external policies , particularly in the area of security . <eos>
as 2014 begins , economic insecurity is giving way to worries about the eu’s strategic position . <eos>
there were expectations that the european council’s december meeting would signal a return to a more outward-looking approach , especially on security matters . <eos>
unfortunately , these hopes were quickly dashed . <eos>
indeed , the disparate assortment of initiatives that were agreed at the meeting , though interesting , lack the needed breadth and scope , and will have to be integrated within a weak and outdated strategic framework . <eos>
the flawed nature of the current european security strategy – drafted in 2003 , with a token revision in 2008 – reflects the circumstances surrounding its conception . <eos>
the ess was developed in the aftermath of the iraq war , amid heated debate over a proposed european constitution , in a hasty and reactive process hijacked by those who sought to position europe as a counterweight – or even a rival power – to the united states . <eos>
making matters worse , the geopolitical environment has changed fundamentally in the decade since the ess was ratified , owing to economic rebalancing toward asia , the upheavals in the arab world , the revival of russian assertiveness , and the rise of isolationist tendencies in the us . <eos>
as a result , the ess does not capture the reality of today’s world – a fact that is obvious from its opening declaration that “ europe has never been so prosperous . ” <eos>
to be sure , the ess’s three basic tenets – development assistance , soft power , and effective multilateralism – remain important . <eos>
but europe’s leaders must reconceive these concepts in light of today’s challenges . <eos>
in terms of development , europe must move away from the idea that aid should be used to bolster trade linkages and acknowledge the importance of foreign investment . <eos>
in fact , net private capital flows to developing countries now outweigh official development assistance by nearly ten to one worldwide . <eos>
as the world’s second-largest source of foreign direct investment , the eu wields considerable influence , with european investors bringing credibility to projects and regions , thereby serving to attract further investment . <eos>
for example , morocco’s ouarzazate solar power plant and its drinking water efficiency program were launched with €37 million ( $50 . 6 million ) from the eu’s neighborhood investment facility; these projects subsequently gained additional funding totaling more than €600 million . <eos>
the ess’s emphasis on soft power is also in urgent need of reassessment . <eos>
the upsurge of protest across the arab world raised expectations among europeans that these countries would , to some extent , emulate western institutions , values , and norms . <eos>
but , while that did not occur , european principles certainly have not lost their allure , as recent protests in ukraine , triggered by president viktor yanukovych’s decision to shun closer ties with europe , have shown . <eos>
nonetheless , the ess’s soft-power vision should not be allowed to obscure the security challenges that europe faces . <eos>
with the rise of non-traditional threats , europeans are increasingly overlooking classical security risks like inter-state warfare , believing that they are no longer relevant – a notion that is reflected in the ess . <eos>
but , as china’s increasingly assertive stance in the south and east china seas starkly demonstrates , this idea is not only wrong; it can be very dangerous . <eos>
this brings us to the ess’s third tenet: advancing “ the development of a stronger international society , well-functioning international institutions , and a rule-based international order . ” <eos>
in this case , the problem comes down to a lack of commitment , with the eu choosing the convenience of informal and ad hoc groupings over the challenge of reforming key institutions like the united nations , the international monetary fund , and the world bank , which are essential for effective multilateralism . <eos>
indeed , the eu is among the leading actors in the current “ g ” fad , which has culminated most recently in the g-20 . <eos>
and , despite being an embodiment of international law , the eu indulges in soft-law approaches , whether at the recent cop-19 climate-change meeting in warsaw , or by supporting the “ geneva agreement ” on iran’s nuclear program , which , it is now clear , is nothing more than two aspirational declarations linked by a press release . <eos>
in developing its new security strategy , europe must consider america’s role as an essential component of the geopolitical environment , viewing the us not as a foil , but as a nuanced partner . <eos>
beyond nato , which remains important even at a low ebb , the proposed transatlantic trade and investment partnership offers a potent opportunity to shape a rule-based international order . <eos>
the shine may have come off the eu , but the gripping scenes from kyiv’s maidan square are a powerful reminder of the enduring appeal of europe’s core values . <eos>
what the eu needs now is an updated external strategy that capitalizes on this allure to bolster its influence , security , and prosperity , thereby halting its slide toward irrelevance . <eos>
the messages of may 25 <eos>
kyiv – europe recently experienced two watershed elections , with very different outcomes . <eos>
whereas ukraine’s presidential election has been widely hailed as the end of the beginning of ukraine’s political transition , the european parliament election has been lamented as the beginning of the end of the idea of an ever-closer union . <eos>
the polls , both held on may 25 , not only provide insight into the mindset of the respective electorates; the behavior of each electorate also offers important lessons for the other . <eos>
ukraine’s election was shaped by an acute awareness of the risks facing the country . <eos>
following the “ euromaidan ” revolution – which brought about the demise of president viktor yanukovych’s government – and a four-month interim administration , this election centered on change . <eos>
yet ukrainians’ chosen president , petro poroshenko , is the very embodiment of the establishment , having served as economics minister under yanukovych and foreign minister under his predecessor , viktor yushchenko , not to mention his position within the country's traditional economic elite . <eos>
this is not as surprising as it might seem . <eos>
ukrainians were making a sober decision , voting with their heads , not their hearts . <eos>
indeed , polls indicate that poroshenko’s appeal lay largely in his focus on immediate internal challenges . <eos>
by contrast , his rivals , most notably yulia tymoshenko , emphasized a rapid shift toward nato and the european union . <eos>
ukrainians also eschewed the temptations of populism and extreme nationalism . <eos>
the poor performance of the right-wing svoboda and right sector candidates – which together won less than 2% of the vote – should finally quash russian assertions of a fascistic regime in kyiv . <eos>
ukrainians hope that poroshenko , with his moderate approach and willingness to negotiate , will be better equipped to resolve the country’s perilous security situation than his more ardent rivals . <eos>
while russian president vladimir putin has recently toned down his rhetoric , violence persists – a clear indication of the challenge that lies ahead . <eos>
indeed , ukraine remains on the verge of becoming a failed state . <eos>
security may be the most pressing issue , but it is certainly not the only one . <eos>
poroshenko’s government must also reinvigorate and strengthen ukraine’s economy . <eos>
doing so requires , first and foremost , measures to halt the decline in foreign direct investment , which fell by 30% from 2012 to 2013 . <eos>
improved governance is also critical – no small challenge for a country that ranks 144th on transparency international’s corruption perceptions index , alongside iran and nigeria . <eos>
ukraine’s election became a focal point for reconstruction . <eos>
the outcome was driven by voters’ recognition of their country’s fundamental problems – starkly apparent in the tents that remain on maidan square , the loss of crimea , and the separatist violence in donbas – and their desire for an effective government to address those problems . <eos>
the next step in this process – a parliamentary election – should occur as soon as possible . <eos>
the european parliament election , by contrast , was an exercise in disruption . <eos>
support for far-right and far-left parties was based on citizens’ frustrations with europe’s flaws , rather than on any realistic , thoughtful agenda . <eos>
populists and euroskeptics fed on the discontent of those who have felt neglected by eu institutions , and now believe that the benefits of the european project , such as freedom of movement , no longer outweigh the burdens , like immigration and austerity . there is growing reticence among europeans about further integration , owing largely to fears that ever-closer union will diminish national identity . <eos>
of course , the notion of returning to the pre-eu world is fundamentally flawed , owing to the simple fact that individual european countries cannot compete in the modern global economy . <eos>
nonetheless , a sense of nostalgia drove many voters’ decisions . simply put , europeans voted from the heart . <eos>
what europe needs is serious debate , not emotional reactions . the problem is that the european commission and the european parliament have consistently failed to generate a compelling narrative , leaving ordinary europeans unconvinced of the eu’s value . <eos>
making matters worse , national and european leaders have allowed – even encouraged – citizens to believe that integration is inevitable , lowering the stakes for european elections . <eos>
this is where the ukrainian election can offer a critical lesson to the eu , despite the vast differences between the challenges that they face . <eos>
the european project is a complicated and ambitious endeavor , the viability of which depends on constant care and adjustment . <eos>
unless europeans recognize that the union is not a given , and acknowledge the value of the prosperity and security that it provides , the recent election may come to be seen not as a wake-up call , but as a swan song for the integration project . <eos>
the european election’s outcome also has a powerful message for ukraine: there are limits to its european prospects . <eos>
to be sure , ukraine has a strong partner in the eu – particularly if its government responds effectively to voters’ call for improved governance . <eos>
but , whatever ukraine achieves , it cannot overcome europeans’ fears of further integration , much less enlargement . that is up to europe . <eos>
in the immediate future , ukraine and the european union must focus on building a functioning relationship . <eos>
for ukraine to push for more , such as by requesting membership in the eu , would be a tactical mistake . <eos>
in this sense , the lesson of the may 25 elections is the same for both ukraine and the eu: it is time for each to put its own house in order . <eos>

america’s strategic blindness <eos>
madrid – the recriminations over us spying activities , triggered by the revelations of the former american intelligence contractor edward j . snowden , have now reached fever pitch . <eos>
questions abound – about what president barack obama knew and when , about the legitimacy of eavesdropping on friendly foreign leaders’ conversations , about the future of transatlantic relations , and even about the meaning of the term “ ally . ” <eos>
but the current firestorm , like other recent diplomatic crises for the united states , reflects a more fundamental problem: the lack of strategic vision in american foreign policy . <eos>
until the us is able to establish an overarching , purpose-oriented framework through which it relates to the world , a reactive approach is inevitable , with high-intensity incidents such as we have seen this month continuing to be the norm . <eos>
for more than 40 years , the cold war policy of containment of soviet influence provided america its strategic framework . <eos>
though us tactics were debated and shifted from administration to administration , the overarching approach remained consistent , because it was broadly supported by republicans and democrats alike . <eos>
of course , an overarching national-security strategy provided no guarantee against problems or even major disasters in countries like vietnam and nicaragua . <eos>
nonetheless , in hindsight , containment infused an order and organization on us foreign policy that is absent today . <eos>
after the fall of the berlin wall , the necessity that had been driving containment disappeared . <eos>
the us , inebriated by victory , saw in the triumph over the soviet bloc another sign of its exceptionalism , and found itself taken in by the mirage that its cold war success was itself a strategy . <eos>
what followed was a decade of scattershot foreign policy marked by notable cases of inaction , together with individual initiatives taken largely without reference to a broader doctrine . <eos>
unchallenged in the world’s unipolar moment , the us had the luxury of not knowing its strategic goals . <eos>
shocked by the attacks of september 11 , the us forced a new framework onto its still-unquestioned belief in the inexorable movement of history toward freedom . <eos>
unfortunately , what emerged was a deeply flawed approach , not least because in declaring a “ war on terror , ” america positioned itself against a tactic , not an entity or an ideology . <eos>
under obama , the us has begun to depart from this approach . <eos>
the problem is that it remains a departure without any meaningful destination . <eos>
as in the 1990’s , the us has no organizing imperative , and the result is the same: a combination of inactivity and incoherent initiatives . <eos>
and , at a time of domestic political polarization , the lack of a global strategy denies a potential rallying point around which democrats and republicans can unite . <eos>
two decades ago , geopolitical conditions limited blowback from america’s foreign-policy vacuum . <eos>
today , the us remains the world’s essential power , but it is no longer the exclusive power . <eos>
it cannot solve problems that directly affect it by acting on its own , though its leadership remains indispensable . <eos>
that is all the more true given that the nature of such problems has also changed . <eos>
america , like the rest of us , is vulnerable to climate change , pandemics , and terrorism – challenges that require coordinated global solutions . <eos>
for the us , however , the utility of multilateralism is purely situational . <eos>
above all , multilateralism is never preferable to a “ good ” bilateral solution – a view that has reinforced behavior that undermines , rather than strengthens , the capacity for effective international action . <eos>
indeed , always ready to negotiate treaties but rarely prepared to sign – and even less likely to ratify – them , the us remains absent from such key global agreements as the kyoto protocol , the mine ban treaty , and the un convention on the law of the sea . <eos>
its inspired creativity and support in building formal institutions like the united nations and world bank has given way to a predilection for weak , informal , and ad hoc groupings , such as the various g-somethings and “ coalitions of the willing . ” <eos>
establishing effective multilateralism requires an emphasis on rules and institutions that facilitate coordination . <eos>
the recent decision by the us to sign the arms trade treaty could be a good start – if only congress could marshal the bipartisan support needed to ratify it . <eos>
but scattered moves in the right direction will not suffice . <eos>
what is really needed is a change in vision and mentality – a shift from viewing multilateralism as a tactic to embracing it as a strategic imperative . <eos>
the current spying scandal is the product of a rudderless us foreign policy focused on narrowly drawn tactical objectives that exist outside the conceptual funnel of a comprehensive vision . <eos>
the result in this case has been damage to the transatlantic relationship , with some in europe even calling for a halt to the talks on the proposed transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( ttip ) . <eos>
suspending the trade talks would be folly , not just in terms of the regional impact , but also because the ttip should be an exercise in rule-making that echoes globally . <eos>
the current diplomatic crisis , too , is an opportunity to ensure that transatlantic discussions about privacy and surveillance reverberate in a multilateral setting; seizing it would represent a small but significant contribution to the strategic vision that has been sorely lacking for the last quarter-century . <eos>
europe’s juncker revolution <eos>
madrid – before his appointment as eu commission president , jean-claude juncker was pilloried as an old-school federalist who would do little to alter the status quo . <eos>
but the new structure that he has imposed on the commission implies a radical overhaul of how things are done in brussels . <eos>
up to now , a focus on who has been appointed to what post – in particular , the appointment of the relatively inexperienced federica mogherini as eu high representative for the common foreign and security policy – has overshadowed the commission’s structural transformation . <eos>
but individual commissioners are far less important than the trends that have caused the commission to shift its priorities from enlargement and the internal market toward energy and monetary union . <eos>
one such trend is europeans’ growing skepticism toward integration , exemplified in may’s european parliament election . <eos>
with newer european union members backsliding – romania on the rule of law , bulgaria in corruption , and hungary on democratic norms under viktor orbán’s government – now is the time , or so it seems , to focus on existing members . <eos>
reinforcing this shift is turkey’s drift toward authoritarianism , which is undermining the viability of its candidacy for eu membership . <eos>
as for ukraine , recent gestures of solidarity , such as the signing of an association agreement , are unlikely to develop into anything substantial in the foreseeable future . <eos>
in downgrading eu enlargement as a formal policy priority , the commission is preparing itself to take other important steps . <eos>
the upheaval among europe’s southern and eastern neighbors may well bring about a long-overdue revamping of the eu’s neighborhood policy . <eos>
and , in pursuit of other avenues for expanding the eu’s reach , european leaders might reinvigorate the european economic area . <eos>
another policy area that has lost its centrality is the internal market – a notable decision , given that it has been the centerpiece of the european project since the commission was created in 1958 . <eos>
the internal market’s four pillars – the free movement of goods , services , capital , and people – have underpinned broader eu measures , in areas like foreign policy and justice and home affairs , and will now be subsumed under new policy labels , from economy and financial affairs to the digital agenda . <eos>
this move away from the internal market can be explained partly by member governments’ aversion to more eu-level legislation . <eos>
though complaints about the “ bloated ” acquis communitaire ( the body of eu law ) are often unfounded , the eu legislative process is not without its shortcomings , as recent attempts at harmonization clearly demonstrate . <eos>
for example , for the eu-wide statutory audit that was completed in april , the european parliament agreed to a revised directive and new regulation that should have been directly applicable in all 28 member countries . <eos>
but , in more than 20 cases , member states were given discretion over its implementation and interpretation . <eos>
the new commission will attempt to change this by focusing on rule implementation and oversight , rather than creation . <eos>
this effort will be coordinated by representatives in seven newly established vice-presidential positions , and spearheaded by the first vice president to have a portfolio focused on “ better regulation . ” <eos>
to be sure , easing regulatory burdens is a longstanding leitmotif of the eu . <eos>
though the last two commissions , led by josé manuel barroso , espoused a commitment to rationalizing , clarifying , and compiling rules , little concrete action has been taken . <eos>
juncker’s changes , however , may portend genuine progress on this front , as well as toward monetary and energy union . <eos>
indeed , the new commission’s structure suggests that juncker hopes to enhance its role in guiding the european monetary union and related policies , control over which largely rested with the european council and eu member governments ( especially germany ) during the crisis . <eos>
similarly , a new vice president has been introduced for energy , which has been reframed as “ energy union . ” <eos>
the lack of progress on this front during the last two commissions was rooted mainly in germany’s russian modernization project , which has shaped its approach to energy security . <eos>
for its part , france has been reluctant to build an interconnected european grid , owing to its heavy reliance on nuclear energy . <eos>
given russian behavior in ukraine , however , eu leaders have been rethinking their approach . <eos>
in this context , the commission’s new structure – not to mention the fact that the new european council president , former polish prime minister donald tusk , has long sought an energy union – may well push the policy forward . <eos>
though it is impossible to understand fully the implications of the commission’s new structure at this early stage , some of its institutional ramifications are already emerging . <eos>
beyond inciting a kind of tug-of-war with the european council , the commission’s shift away from lawmaking will alter the european parliament’s role , which it has forged over the last five years on the back of the commission’s active legislative agenda . <eos>
with little authority to initiate legislation , the parliament , too , will have no choice but to pivot toward oversight . <eos>
precisely how all of this all plays out in the coming months and years will determine whether the european project progresses or stagnates . <eos>
perhaps observers should be paying a little less attention to the “ who ” and a bit more to the “ what . ” <eos>
africa beyond ebola <eos>
madrid – among this summer’s grave global worries , the spread of the ebola virus has monopolized the discussion of sub-saharan africa and reinvigorated hoary notions of disorder and despair – at a time when a new image of a dynamic africa was emerging . <eos>
in fact , there is still strong reason for optimism about the region’s prospects . <eos>
the ebola outbreak overshadowed three key events affecting the region . <eos>
on july 1 , a major organizational restructuring at the world bank group was implemented . <eos>
two weeks later , the brics ( brazil , russia , india , china , and south africa ) announced the establishment of the new development bank . <eos>
and , in early august , african government and business leaders gathered in washington , dc , for a summit that could portend transformative private investment in africa . <eos>
such investment is essential in a world in which net private capital flows to developing countries outstrip official development assistance by a margin of ten to one . <eos>
if this is to be a turning point for africa , rather than another false dawn , this summer must be the start of a prolonged effort to stimulate private-sector engagement . <eos>
the reorganization of the world bank is a central part of a larger effort under its president , jim yong kim , to reposition the bank as a facilitator vis-a-vis the private sector , rather than a primary provider . <eos>
from 2009 to 2013 , new investment commitments by the international finance corporation , the world bank’s private-sector lending arm , have risen 73% . <eos>
meanwhile , the multilateral investment guarantee agency , the bank’s provider of political risk insurance covering investments in developing countries , has moved to expand its activities , both by broadening the types of projects that it supports and widening existing definitions to allow greater coverage . <eos>
july’s restructuring occurs within the context of these broader moves . <eos>
in reorganizing the world bank group’s central component , the international bank for reconstruction and development , kim has adopted a management-consulting model that unites expertise with regional coverage . <eos>
seeking to eliminate the bureaucratic “ silos ” that have isolated regional experts from one another , 14 global practice groups in areas such as energy , water , and education have been established to bring to bear the full force of the world bank’s considerable knowledge on projects and partnerships . <eos>
just as the world bank was repositioning itself , the brics agreed to establish their own bank . <eos>
there are significant outstanding issues about how the new development bank will operate , but early indications suggest that infrastructure will be central to its activities , with an emphasis on africa . <eos>
the world bank estimates that insufficient infrastructure reduces productivity in africa by approximately 40% . <eos>
the entrance of a new player with initial authorized capital of $100 billion – along with the united states’ power africa program , which has garnered $26 billion in commitments since its launch last year , and the world bank’s new global infrastructure facility – promises to help ease infrastructure financing significantly . <eos>
but , as of now , the new development bank is little more than a statement of political solidarity , and whether it comes into existence remains to be seen . <eos>
even if it does begin to function , the brics lack what gives development banks , and the world bank in particular , legitimacy and weight: a staff composed mostly of dedicated experts who are among the world’s best . <eos>
finally , the high profile of the us-africa leaders summit , with more than 40 heads of state in attendance , as well as president barack obama’s direct involvement , generated buzz about africa . <eos>
us businesses and investors certainly gained more awareness about africa’s potential and a deeper understanding of the variety of investment climates throughout the continent . <eos>
but , though the summit may be called a success , its long-term implications are unclear , particularly given the uncertainty about what will follow . <eos>
at the moment , there does not seem to be a plan to institutionalize the summit . <eos>
moreover , the participation of so many heads of state overshadowed that of african business leaders . <eos>
the practical connections that us companies will need when deciding whether to invest could have been cultivated on the summit’s margins , or in its aftermath , but were not . <eos>
laying a foundation for future engagement requires ongoing commitment and effort that goes beyond mere publicity . <eos>
the same could be said about the world bank . <eos>
there is much work to be done in integrating the new organizational model with existing bank structures and practice areas . <eos>
even if this transition occurs seamlessly , the bank faces a serious internal struggle against entrenched bureaucratic interests and a pervasive institutional mindset that is overly risk-averse and fixates on processes rather than outcomes . <eos>
in recent years , africa , once a land of pity , has emerged as a land of opportunity . <eos>
if it is to become a land of performance , the goal must be to facilitate investment , both domestic and foreign . <eos>
that will demand effort and commitment; given that a stable international order increasingly depends on a prosperous and growing africa , it is a goal that the world cannot afford to miss . <eos>
europe’s iranian imperative <eos>
madrid – last month , with the world’s attention fixed on the crisis in crimea and the search for malaysian airlines flight 370 , the latest round of negotiations between iran and the p5+1 ( the united states , china , france , russia , and the united kingdom , plus germany ) passed quietly in vienna . <eos>
even with discussions set to continue next week , the talks’ outcome remains far from certain – and world leaders cannot afford to become distracted . <eos>
this is especially true for europe , whose unified approach to iran has been invaluable up to this point . <eos>
indeed , it was the bite of european sanctions that ultimately brought iran to the negotiating table , and the force of unified european diplomacy facilitated the “ joint plan of action , ” which set out the terms for reaching a comprehensive long-term agreement within six months . <eos>
but now , at the plan’s halfway point , there has been little concrete progress , with last month’s negotiations producing no headway on two key issues being discussed: the acceptable level for uranium enrichment in iran and the future of the heavy-water reactor at arak . <eos>
the sharp contrast between this lack of achievement and iran’s recent declarations about reaching a final deal by july raises important questions about iran’s strategy and goals – questions that negotiators must consider carefully when determining the best approach . <eos>
the key to success is the background against which the process plays out . <eos>
iran is a land of contrasts . <eos>
on a recent visit organized by the european council on foreign relations ( ecfr ) , the coexistence of entrenched tradition and rapid transformation was starkly apparent . <eos>
central tehran – ebullient with young people and high-heeled women donning testimonial headscarves and mid-thigh jackets over pants – embodies a thirst for openness . <eos>
more than 60% of iranians were born after the 1979 islamic revolution , and more than 40% were born after the iran-iraq war of the 1980’s . <eos>
for them , the revolution is a part of history , not the main source of their personal values . <eos>
the toll taken by years of tough economic sanctions is also apparent . <eos>
despite iranian officials’ best efforts to downplay the sanctions’ impact , it is difficult to spin inflation in excess of 30% and projected gdp growth of just 1% this year . <eos>
the combination of a young population and a crumbling economy is a combustible mix , one that amounts to an existential threat to the regime – and the regime knows it . <eos>
in this sense , the imperative to reach a prosperity-enhancing agreement with the international community is greater than ever for iran’s leadership . <eos>
furthermore , iran’s negotiating style , like its capital city , can be both fatiguing and confusing . <eos>
just moments after elaborating at length on the koran’s prohibition of nuclear weapons , an interlocutor would declare that the underground fordow nuclear facility’s impregnability to airstrikes must be central to any deal . <eos>
the reality is that iran does not envisage giving up its nuclear breakout capacity . <eos>
the negotiations are aimed not at eradication , but at lengthening lead-time – specifically , limiting uranium-enrichment levels to 3 . 5% , establishing a strong inspections regime , and reaching an agreement on the arak nuclear facility . <eos>
but even this may not happen . <eos>
after all , iranian officials have thus far not demonstrated their commitment to accepting stringent and verifiable checks . <eos>
moreover , iran has managed to separate the nuclear negotiations from broader , related issues like its ballistic-missile program , its support for groups like hezbollah , and its domestic human-rights record . <eos>
with the us loath to introduce potential spoilers into the mix , there is no chance that any of these issues will be up for discussion . <eos>
in this context , eu high representative catherine ashton’s meeting with dissidents during her most recent trip to tehran was merely a symbolic gesture . <eos>
this leaves iran the opening it needs to place a strategic bet that the syrian conflict will generate increasing friction between the west and iran’s regional archrival , saudi arabia . <eos>
for iran , a staunch supporter of syrian president bashar al-assad’s regime , a weaker us-saudi relationship is key to shifting the regional balance of power – especially if it is accompanied by the easing of western economic sanctions . <eos>
to some degree , this hope is reinforced by iran’s perception of us president barack obama as a motivated partner in the nuclear talks . <eos>
after all , a long-term agreement would be both a singular foreign-policy achievement for obama and a boon to his efforts to disentangle the us from the middle east . <eos>
but iran also recognizes that the clock is ticking . <eos>
obama’s presidency is coming to an end , the republicans are poised to regain control of the senate in november’s mid-term election , and democrats are increasingly reticent to be viewed as “ soft on iran . ” <eos>
as a result , the us congress appears to be growing more hostile toward a deal; indeed , the longer it takes to conclude a final agreement , the more likely congress is to scupper it . <eos>
in this context , europe has a key role to play . <eos>
while europe’s reputation for foreign-policy “ softness ” continues to shape iranian perceptions , the eu’s role in compelling iran to negotiate underpins the current talks . <eos>
likewise , it was france’s insistence on more stringent controls that initially blocked the agreement in geneva last november . <eos>
a decade ago , europe disappointed iran by withdrawing from negotiations , under pressure from the us – a move that some have suggested aided former iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad’s rise to power . <eos>
today , europe will be critical to driving progress , particularly in the event that the us congress torpedoes a sensible agreement . <eos>
indeed , on iran , europe’s unified approach has enabled it to have a greater impact than on any other significant foreign-policy issue . <eos>
this should be regarded as a model for the future and a lesson for the present . <eos>
by preserving its unity of purpose and maintaining the pressure and negotiating momentum that it has generated , europe can demonstrate to iran , the us , and itself that it has what it takes to be a major global actor . <eos>
forsaken syria <eos>
madrid – in this year of ubiquitous commemorations , the centennial of jan karski’s birth has been largely overlooked . <eos>
and yet karski’s legacy is more important than ever – nowhere more so than in syria . <eos>
as the geneva ii peace process slogs along – leaving cadavers and atrocities to pile up – karski’s dedication to bringing the plight of poland’s jews to the world’s attention during world war ii , despite the inertia of governments and publics , embodies exactly what syria desperately needs . <eos>
in 1942 , karski , a polish-born diplomat , traveled to the united kingdom to report on what came to be called the holocaust . <eos>
the next year , he embarked on a mission to the united states to brief president franklin d . roosevelt and other dignitaries on the horrors that he had witnessed . <eos>
in both cases , he was met with skepticism and apathy . <eos>
indeed , it was only toward the end of the war that action was taken to stop the slaughter . <eos>
although the holocaust is a category of persecution sui generis , one cannot avoid thinking of karski in light of the international community’s approach to syria today . <eos>
expectations for the geneva talks are so low that trivial matters – such as the fact that president bashar al-assad’s negotiators and the opposition are sitting together in the same room ( though not at the same table ) – are being hailed as successes . <eos>
even the agreement to allow women and children to leave blockaded areas of the city of homs – an anti-assad stronghold – fell far short of international mediators’ vision ( and even this achievement seems to be in doubt ) . <eos>
instead of allowing a united nations aid convoy to bring humanitarian aid to the area , the government agreed to release women and children on an as-yet-uncertain timeline , while men can leave only after their names had been cleared , raising fears of arrest . <eos>
meanwhile , amid plodding deliberations of incremental steps that are clearly inadequate , syrians are being displaced , wounded , tortured , and killed in droves . <eos>
by any measure , the level of suffering in syria is shocking . <eos>
although figures do not convey the cruelty by all sides , it has become de rigueur to cite the numbers: more than 100 , 000 dead , 2 . 3 million refugees , and four million people internally displaced . <eos>
but a year ago , the figures were already dire: 60 , 000 dead , 700 , 000 international refugees , and two million internally displaced . <eos>
if there were a threshold of misery that would cause the world to say , “ enough is enough , ” it surely would have been crossed by now . <eos>
the ugly truth is that the world’s response to this crisis has been shaped by geopolitical interests , not the need to put an end to appalling human suffering . <eos>
indeed , it is no secret that the conflict serves as a proxy for larger struggles – between saudi arabia and iran , saudi arabia and qatar , the us and iran , russia and the us , shia and sunni muslims , and moderates and extremists – and that resolving it will require significant effort on all of these fronts . <eos>
from an american perspective , syria is not strategically critical . <eos>
president barack obama’s administration has maintained an intensely inward-looking focus , reinforced by a public wary of foreign engagements . <eos>
nothing short of a drastic change in the conflict’s nature that threatened america’s core interests would lead to direct us involvement . <eos>
guilt , after all , is a poor motivator for international action . <eos>
even the uk and france – the only two countries that were not shy about threatening military action against assad’s regime – got cold feet when confronted with the possibility of going it alone . <eos>
instead , the world is responding to graphic images of unspeakable brutality – torture by the regime or executions carried out by the opposition – with sterile shows of outrage . <eos>
the stream of statements , half-measures , and clumsy initiatives has done little to improve the situation – and , in some instances , has made things worse . <eos>
consider obama’s call , backed by no action , for assad to “ step aside , ” and his repeated promises , dating to early 2012 , to provide non-lethal aid to the syrian opposition – promises that were finally fulfilled late last year , and then only temporarily . <eos>
this gap between rhetoric and action left a vacuum; saudi arabia , qatar , and private donors subsequently filled it by channeling support to extremist elements of the opposition , strengthening their hand at the expense of those being called moderates . <eos>
but the most infamous example of this policy paralysis was obama’s 2012 declaration that the use of chemical weapons was the “ red line ” beyond which the us would be forced to intervene . <eos>
his ultimate failure to follow through on his proclamation emboldened and , in a way , re-legitimized assad . <eos>
it remains to be seen whether geneva ii will follow this pattern . <eos>
the price of the talks has already been high , with all sides having ramped up violence to strengthen their respective positions ahead of the negotiations . <eos>
this is to say nothing of the fiasco surrounding the withdrawn invitation to iran , whose buy-in will be essential for any resolution . <eos>
in any case , the incremental nature of the talks belies the situation’s urgency . <eos>
amid the current focus on regime change , a transitional government , and negotiating delegations , there is a real danger that the desperate humanitarian situation will be overlooked . <eos>
here , citizens have a critical role to play . <eos>
but , like their leaders , publics everywhere have been reticent to act . <eos>
indeed , opinion polls show that , despite near-universal awareness of the situation in syria , there is very little public support for intervention . <eos>
but handwringing will not help; we – individuals – must accept real responsibility for ending the tragedy and press our leaders to act . <eos>
it has been more than 70 years since karski presented his report to the world . <eos>
in that time , we have created the united nations , adopted the universal declaration of human rights , and discussed endlessly governments’ “ responsibility to protect ” their citizens . <eos>
yet , watching the syrian tragedy develop , one might conclude that nothing has changed . how many times must we say , “ never again ” ? <eos>
a nation of vidiots <eos>
new york – the past half-century has been the age of electronic mass media . <eos>
television has reshaped society in every corner of the world . <eos>
now an explosion of new media devices is joining the tv set: dvds , computers , game boxes , smart phones , and more . <eos>
a growing body of evidence suggests that this media proliferation has countless ill effects . <eos>
the united states led the world into the television age , and the implications can be seen most directly in america’s long love affair with what harlan ellison memorably called “ the glass teat . ” <eos>
in 1950 , fewer than 8% of american households owned a tv; by 1960 , 90% had one . <eos>
that level of penetration took decades longer to achieve elsewhere , and the poorest countries are still not there . <eos>
true to form , americans became the greatest tv watchers , which is probably still true today , even though the data are somewhat sketchy and incomplete . <eos>
the best evidence suggests that americans watch more than five hours per day of television on average – a staggering amount , given that several hours more are spent in front of other video-streaming devices . <eos>
other countries log far fewer viewing hours . <eos>
in scandinavia , for example , time spent watching tv is roughly half the us average . <eos>
the consequences for american society are profound , troubling , and a warning to the world – though it probably comes far too late to be heeded . <eos>
first , heavy tv viewing brings little pleasure . <eos>
many surveys show that it is almost like an addiction , with a short-term benefit leading to long-term unhappiness and remorse . <eos>
such viewers say that they would prefer to watch less than they do . <eos>
moreover , heavy tv viewing has contributed to social fragmentation . <eos>
time that used to be spent together in the community is now spent alone in front of the screen . <eos>
robert putnam , the leading scholar of america’s declining sense of community , has found that tv viewing is the central explanation of the decline of “ social capital , ” the trust that binds communities together . <eos>
americans simply trust each other less than they did a generation ago . <eos>
of course , many other factors are at work , but television-driven social atomization should not be understated . <eos>
certainly , heavy tv viewing is bad for one’s physical and mental health . <eos>
americans lead the world in obesity , with roughly two-thirds of the us population now overweight . <eos>
again , many factors underlie this , including a diet of cheap , unhealthy fried foods , but the sedentary time spent in front of the tv is an important influence as well . <eos>
at the same time , what happens mentally is as important as what happens physically . <eos>
television and related media have been the greatest purveyors and conveyors of corporate and political propaganda in society . <eos>
america’s tv ownership is almost entirely in private hands , and owners make much of their money through relentless advertising . <eos>
effective advertising campaigns , appealing to unconscious urges – typically related to food , sex , and status – create cravings for products and purchases that have little real value for consumers or society . <eos>
the same , of course , has happened to politics . <eos>
american politicians are now brand names , packaged like breakfast cereal . <eos>
anybody – and any idea – can be sold with a bright ribbon and a catchy jingle . <eos>
all roads to power in america lead through tv , and all access to tv depends on big money . <eos>
this simple logic has put american politics in the hands of the rich as never before . <eos>
even war can be rolled out as a new product . <eos>
the bush administration promoted the premises of the iraq war – saddam hussein’s non-existent weapons of mass destruction –in the familiar colorful , fast-paced , and graphics-heavy style of television advertising . <eos>
then the war itself began with the so-called “ shock and awe ” bombing of baghdad – a made-for-tv live spectacle aimed at ensuring high ratings for the us-led invasion . <eos>
many neuroscientists believe that the mental-health effects of tv viewing might run even deeper than addiction , consumerism , loss of social trust , and political propaganda . <eos>
perhaps tv is rewiring heavy viewers’ brains and impairing their cognitive capacities . <eos>
the american academy of pediatrics recently warned that tv viewing by young children is dangerous for their brain development , and called on parents to keep children under two away from the tv and similar media . <eos>
a recent survey in the us by the organization common sense media reveals a paradox , but one that is perfectly understandable . <eos>
children in poor american households today not only watch more tv than children in wealthy households , but are also more likely to have a television in their room . <eos>
when a commodity’s consumption falls as income rises , economists call it an “ inferior ” good . <eos>
to be sure , the mass media can be useful as a provider of information , education , entertainment , and even political awareness . <eos>
but too much of it is confronting us with dangers that we need to avoid . <eos>
at the very least , we can minimize those dangers . <eos>
successful approaches around the world include limits on tv advertising , especially to young children; non-commercial , publicly-owned tv networks like the bbc; and free ( but limited ) tv time for political campaigns . <eos>
of course , the best defense is our own self-control . <eos>
we can all leave the tv off more hours per day and spend that time reading , talking with each other , and rebuilding the bases of personal health and social trust . <eos>
anatomy of a crisis <eos>
berkeley – getting out of our current financial mess requires understanding how we got into it in the first place . <eos>
the fundamental cause , according to the likes of john mccain , was greed and corruption on wall street . <eos>
though not one to deny the existence of such base motives , i would insist that the crisis has its roots in key policy decisions stretching back over decades . <eos>
in the united states , there were two key decisions . <eos>
the first , in the 1970’s , deregulated commissions paid to stockbrokers . <eos>
the second , in the 1990’s , removed the glass-steagall act’s restrictions on mixing commercial and investment banking . <eos>
